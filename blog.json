The general idea  is to try and keep friends and family updated as to where we are and what were up to over the next year and a bit, by sharing stories and photos! If nothing else, I'm hoping this will keep my mum (<em>fairly</em>) sane :)\n\nThe first stage of our <strong>EPIC</strong> adventure is a nine week stay in Accra, Ghana where we will be putting Jo's teaching expertise and my knowledge of paper aeroplanes to good use in a charity run school. As we leave in a week and six days I'm getting mega excited and the whole thing is starting to feel pretty real! We've been told that the school has an I.T suite so this blog can be updated but seeing as during Jo's last visit they were teaching lessons outside I'm expecting to modify my interpretations of the phrase \"I.T suite\" somewhat.\n\nAnyway, now that the blog is set up I have other things on my 'To Do' list which need attention before flight day so until next time!\n\nTake care!\n\nTom",

        "contents": "<p style=\"text-align:left;\">As the title states, we now reside in Africa!!</p>\nAfter landing pretty late at night we were picked up from the airport by Pat and her husband who took us to our new accomodation. Its the old teaching centre which has been converted and I'm told our bedroom is the old computer room. We have our own bathroom (empty room with bucket and hole in the wall for the water to drain out!) toilet and kitchen. We share the compound with a guy called Evens who also works for BASICS and as yet we havn't locked each other out!\n\nThe kitchen is fairly basic, we have a microwave (with a grill) and a fridge but we are yet to discover the cutlery and all we have to put in the fridge are the 39 little bags of water (500ml) which cost us the equivalent of 30p... yeh. We are hoping to get Auntie Via to teach us how to cook local dishes. The kids get cooking lessons so it shouldn't be difficult for us to eaves drop! Speaking of the food,its really great! We currently tally one spicy scrambled egg, a dish of red red (black eyed beans) and plantain, spicy sausage and pasta, and from the market, what we think was fish, rice and spice but it was too dark to really see! We're using the internet at the school so will hopefully be able to keep ontop of updates as and when our attention isn't taken by the kids (which are by the way, amazing!). The past two days have been pretty full on at BASICS, the kids are as crazy and unruly as before. I'd forgotten how much they love to punch one another!\n\nThere's currently a missionary group here who have their own program organised which has given us a chance just to sit back, figure out how things work and also try and learn a few (of the 120 plus staff) names!\n\nAnyway, the computer room has open windows and the dance and drumming class <strong>really</strong> are getting into the swing of things now making it a tad difficult to think.\n\nUntil next time,\n\nTom &amp; Jo",

        "contents": "This week at BASICS, a missionary group have been leading a programme of dance, crafts and games. Some of which went down really well, whilst others went over their heads. Attempts to get the youngest to cut and stick inspirational pictures and words, meant exactly that as they cut them to shreds and glued the picture side down, leaving bits of adverts facing up. However, the rotation element of the group activities has given us a chance interact with all the kids on a near one-to-one basis. There are far too many unique personalities and cheeky chappies to even begin mentioning them all, but they have kept us all entertained/on our feet all week and we can't wait for eight more like it!\n\nLikewise, the local community have embraced us. We can't go a few feet without hearing \"Tom, Tom\", which changes popping out for some rice to more like a paparazzi experience. One woman even promised that if we returned tomorrow she would give him her baby, a promise we thought was going to be fulfilled as we returned tonight to find her with the infant in her arms rushing towards us.\n\nOn Thursday evening Pat (founder and boss lady of BASICS) took us to a local beach resort, although erase every preconceived image you had of resort and you're somewhat closer to reality. We were the only customers that night but we still had to hunt around for chairs, which wasn't helped by one of the mission group snapping two legs of his chair and hitting the deck! The music was very loud but the place had a great feel to it and it allowed us to get to know the other volunteers, Pat and Allotay (Pat's husband) in a social setting other than that of BASICS. We also went for a walk with them during the day down to the local beach, which I may well have told many of you about before. It was interesting to see all the local men preparing the fishing nets and boats, but let's just say we won't be swimming in the sea any time soon! <a href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/dscf10151.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-38\" title=\"DSCF1015[1]\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/dscf10151.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n\nThis was followed on Friday by salsa on Friday evening at an outdoor bar where we were dragged on stage and taught some moves, only to learn they were to 'Mambo number 5'!\n\nLove Jo and Tom",

        "contents": "Yesterday saw us celebrate a thanksgiving style occasion with the kids at BASIC's. The day started with Auntie Pat's pastor from the big apple arriving and giving an opening blessing followed quickly by a show of Azunto (African dancing), drumming and singing by a local troup. The kids had been practising their dance for a few weeks so they had it pretty sharp and after getting changed into their outfits quickly fell into the swing of things. Next up was food and man... it was so good! The center had ordered in a full pig and we managed to get a share of the belly pork and chicken! Trust me, it tastes <strong>EVEN</strong> better when you've eaten predominantly beans, fish and rice for a week! (That being said, the Red-Red we sometimes have for breakfast which is a mixture of black eyed beans, fried plantain and sauce is AMAZING) The remainder of the day consisted of all the kids, super charged on the sugary drinks they were treated to, trying to teach me and Jo to dance like the display. I gotta say, it gets tiring fast and my knees don't quite let me pull off some of the moves as well as the younger, flexible kids. I did have a trump card however, showing them the cheesy dance move where you shuffle your hands between your knees. Hopefully this photo of Godfred attempting the manouvere will help you understand a tad better. <a href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/dscf1051.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-36 aligncenter\" title=\"DSCF1051\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/dscf1051.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\nAfter many hours of non stop dancing the evening finally drew to a close and we headed home. The party itself had gone great, everyone had had a brilliant time and the kids were  well behaved. This mornings session with them has quickly reminded us that this rare pheonomenon only reallys occurs in these party sessions!\n\nLove Tom &amp; Jo",

        "title": "Slavery and Rainforests",
        "contents": "The second of our weekends in Ghana was spent west of Accra in Cape Coast. This involved a three hour journey in what can only be described as a rehashed transit van/rusty box with \"wheels\"/most widely used transport in Ghana, the Tro tro. This was my first time using such a method of transport and it is definitely an experience I will remember. You see, Ghanaian drivers have this habit of spending most of their journey on the wrong side of the road performing some daring overtaking manoeuvre. This, and the sardine style ethos of a seating plan  (what with vehicle capacity limits somewhat negotiable depending on how desperate you are to get where you're going) removed all chances of sleep!\n\nOn arrival at Cape Coast our first visit was to the castle, initially built by Swedish traders in 1653. Ghana was heavily involved in the slave trade and thus most of its castles and forts, if not originally built for, were used for this purpose. Cape Coast (and the nearby Elmina) were no exception. The white washed walls and Spanish style windows give away its European heritage. Although  an interesting building and likewise its role in history, the horrors and reality of what occurred there were very sobering. This was especially the case when standing in the condemned cell, a claustrophobic room devoid of light used to lock up unruly slaves to be left in to die. On a happier note we caved at lunchtime and had our first western meal, pizza and beer by the beach! We sat at Oasis Beach resort to satisfy our hunger whilst watching the, not so calm African coastline and fisherman. A lovely spot kitted out with palm trees and the like to chill out at but their advice on transport to Elmina was not quite up to scratch. We were quoted 40Ghc and we ended up paying 3.30Ghc for a taxi on the way there and 1.50Ghc on the way back for a Tro! Elmina itself is also known for its fort and therefore involvement with the slave trade. As the largest fort in Ghana, the distinction between slave and governor/soldier hit home to a greater extent. Similarly the sheer size of the place highlights how many lives were affected there. Conditions were so bad for the slaves that standing or crouching in the tightly packed holding cells were the only options in the unsanitary conditions. More harrowing was walking through the door of no return and experiencing every slaves last view of Africa before embarking on their cargo like journey into the unknown.\n\nSunday saw us visit Kakum, a national park protecting a rainforest. The park sports the world famous canopy walk, a series of tree top rope bridges connecting viewing platforms up to 40m high. We were informed by George, our guide, that maintanence takes place every six months and worn parts are repaired or replaced. In that case, its probably been about five months and 29 days since the last check up! Regardless of this, it was extremely worthwhile as the views incredible both to the rainforest floor and far into the distance. We had hoped to see some wildlife but the majority of our tour group being made of noisy Ghanians probably scared away anything within a three mile radius! In a further attempt we spend our near to final Ghanaian GHc on a nature walk. Our guide, George, informed us of the uses of all the trees and plants but our wildlife tally ranked at one frog and a few butterflies! To get back from Kakum we scraped together our final coins (much to our fellow Tro tro users amusement) and headed back to Cape Coast in desperate need of an ATM! I was rather pale by this point! But all's well that ends well, we made the two and a half hour Tro tro ride back to Accra in one piece, even after our driver trying something different from the usual \"overtaking\" to avoid traffic and instead went for the old, off roading through local back alleys and gutters to save us five minutes. Were pretty sure we were further back in the queue then we started!\n\nUntil the next post!\n\nLove Tom &amp; Jo",

        "title": "Vacation Programme",
        "contents": "As school doesn't start until the 4th September, BASICS has been running its vacation programme. This involves splitting the children up into different activities and often just allowing them to be kids. Tom and I were soon put to good use, with me being sent up stairs to the IT suite and with no further warning asked to show them educational websites! Hmm... BBC it is then. Considering that the four children under my care were usually left to their own devises whilst the actual IT teacher taught a further 10 or so how to build their own websites, they were extremely receptive maths and spelling games. That was until the novelty wore off and the following days they were hoping for brand new games to entertain them. Even google couldn't save me, as everytime I found a suitable game they'd either stray off and find the one and only football game on the website, or they'd click an advert and I'd find them trying to guess passwords and even put in made up account information for payments!\n\nMeanwhile, Tom was putting his skills to good use teaching the bass guitar! Although five days of rehearsals that he witnessed and presumably the entire summer holidays, the 5 strong band were only learning one song. Just the slight hum of 'Lean On Me' is guaranteed to drive him mad now, he's even had dreams about it! Whenever we'd reconvene for lunch he would look so drained and frustrated at their lack of ability, however this did improve and 4/5 were able to perform in the final vacation programme show with great success. This was the first time I'd heard them, and was pleasantly surprised, although it was a massive help that I knew what song was they were trying to play!! Afternoons were spent playing board games with a majority of the children and therefore a range of ages. As I knew the rules of Othello, it was soon passed to me to explain, and consequently every day after that it seemed to follow me. Many a time I thought it was all going well, until half way through a game they'd try to place their piece surrounded by their own colour! Time to call over another kid to translate, but they would then try to take over! This was nothing to the games of pairs we have witnessed, with the youngest children scrapping at wooden blocks often with no concept of taking turns. They had clearly formed a system of markings on the backs of the cards and so have removed the whole concept of the game, (I saw one girl biting the corners so to leave marks in certain places) that and the fact they used to shuffle them around!\n\nI also played the occasional game of connect four. The most memorable being against Rebecca, who must only be about 3/4. We started as normal, she was red and I was black, but we only got a few pieces in when she decided she had won so tipped all of the pieces in her pile. The next game was then a mixture of her playing both red and black pieces. In one round all the pieces played were black and she still managed to win somehow!! She thought it was fantastic though and was grinning the whole time at her amazing winning streak. Not sure she'll have quite the same luck against one of the other children!\n\nTom's game of choice/ one he'll never want to play again was Monopoly. The children have an amazing grasp of money, however as they still refer to old and new currency here, being told you owe the banker 10000 can be interpreted as 10. Playing 'Game of Life' was also an interested experience we both had, neither of us even attempted to introduce stocks and share! Was pretty entertaining to hear Tom try and explain what a honeymoon was to a group of 8 year olds though!\n\nAlso during this week, the cook at BASICS, Aunty Vida took us to the local market. This required us to be up by 6.30 but was completely worth it. There was so much going on and the most bizarre things being sold next to each other, likewise there were rows of people selling the exact same thing. Tom and I attracted a fair bit of attention and strange looks, people talking to us in Ga or attempting to talk in English then laughing their heads of off the moment we responded. Managed to get lots of food here, mainly fruit and veg, but didn't taste any of it as we were given an unexpected week off so it all went off. We know where it is now so we'll be back, we've also realised we probably don't need to be up quite so early!!\n\nFinal day of the programme and it was performance time. Fortunately for me, spelling games aren't a spectating event, so I was able to sit back and enjoy the show. Was lovely to see all the other groups display what they'd been working on. There was singing, dancing, poetry, drama  and of course guitar! We got somewhat distracted by the mass of younger brothers and sisters who had come to BASIC's to see the show. They all wanted to wave and talk to us despite us trying to turn their attention back to the performances. One girl even turned her chair to face us with her back to the stage! Our favourite little kid kept us entertained by falling asleep on his chair, his head constantly falling and jolting back as he dozed in an out of slumber! We saw him a short while later, carrying his flip flops, and yawning as he sauntered back to his mother.\n\nLove Jo and Tom",

        "contents": "So this post is pretty overdue but we've been pretty busy! A little under a fortnight ago we spent the better part of a week travelling the far western coast of Ghana. It was slightly unexpected, in the sense that we left Accra with the intention of being away for 3 days and ended up spending about 8 days travelling around! Having only packed enough supplies for the 3 days we quickly ran out of the essentials... the main thing being insect repellent, and boy did we pay for it!\n\nFresh from the party at BASIC's on Thursday we jumped on our first night Tro tro to Takoradi. It was a fairly easy task to get to and on the tro but having not been on a night tro before, we we in no way prepared for the journey ahead! The daring over taking manoeuvres are somewhat more intense and unnerving when all you see are two (or sometimes one) headlight approaching you at speed! Luckily for us the whole experience was made <em>slightly</em> more relaxing as our tro came pre fitted with mood lighting (check out the photo, it cracked me up no end!) and this feature was particularly useful at the several police roadblocks we passed through.\n\nDespite not having booked any accommodation in Takaradi, the first hotel we stopped at had plenty of rooms available. We soon got the impression they don't get busy until the early hours of the morning which became even more apparent as we took our walk to our room, passing several of the women involved in such business arrangements! Never the less, after the journey there we were too tired to go looking elsewhere and due to a broken TV and fridge without a plug socket Jo managed to negotiate the price a bit lower (she gets scary when she's tired!)\n\nIn the morning we were quick to rise and as Takoradi was only a stepping stone on the journey to our beaches in the west, we headed to the local tro station. We needn't have rushed however, as we waited nearly two hours for our Tro to fill up, apparently people aren't that keen to leave the old oil hub of Takoradi, that or they really love the Hotels for their nightly entertainment!\n\nRegardless, once we were under way, it was not long until the entertainment of our own began. You see, the roads to Beyin aren't much more than dirt tracks carved through the undergrowth and are quick to form dust clouds when one of the many plant trucks go past. We were lucky (or unlucky) enough to experience this several times when we had no choice but to put full trust in our drivers knowledge of the roads, as looking out the window was completely pointless! It really was like we'd driven into a giant orange marshmallow! He proved his devotion to us again when he came to our rescue at our destination by walking us to our guest house, even though this was in the opposite direction to the sign and we weren't 100% sure he knew where he was going! Anyway, he dropped us off at a lovely spot (bar) called the Step by Step where we were told to await our host. We weren't too concerned about being left as we'd called him earlier and he said there was plenty of space so decided to dig in. The women he left us with spoke no English and frequently left us to our own devices, being sat outside in the baking heat this quickly turned into getting a (unfortunately luke warm) beer and a spot of people watching. We were unsure of how long we needed to wait so eventually cracked out a pack of cards whilst watching another local woman clean, gut and scale an entire net of fish. It didn't look easy, not to mention that all the local wildlife seemed rather intent of getting a free meal. We did try to do our bit to help by scaring off the local chickens, they did seem however to have an unhealthy lack of fear of the rocks we threw at them. It even crossed my mind if we got hit one hard enough it would probably end up on our plate that evening, seeing as most the fish didn't stay long  in her bowl! Shortly after Steven showed up, upon seeing that we'd made ourselves comfortable he too grabbed a drink and began the tale of why he hadn't been around. It seemed that his spot was the social hub of the village as towards the evening a rather large crowd of locals (large being about 10 in the size of village we were in) turned up to catch up on the latest news. Although this was delivered on a battery powered radio strapped to the side of his spot at about 40\u00ba to the horizontal, they did manage to get pretty good signal to which the Chelsea game was blasted out of. We talked to one fella about his life in Kumasi and how he came back to Beyin to look after his mother. This is somewhat impressive as the trip from Kumasi probably takes him the best part of a day to complete! Steven turned back up a while later, he cooked us some Jollof rice (no idea on spelling) and a bit of fresh octopus and fish. A very well received meal after a long day. Post eating we shattered and asked him to take us to the room we'd booked. He disappeared for a few seconds and when returned, came bearing a strobe light which he could have just pulled of a wall for all we knew.\n\nThe room we stayed in was actually built on the beach. A raffia palm construction, it had four rooms to it with a shared toilet and shower. I'd guess at about 8 strides to the water from our front door which was fantastic for the price we paid. It was a tad moist though and dropped a bit cold at night but for the fly on the wall experience in the village it was a much better choice than the resort further up, if only for the time spent with Steven! The real point in coming to Beyin (apart from the amazing beach) was the village on stilts in the Amansuri wetlands. The tourist office is based in Beyin and by 7am the following morning we were in a canoe with our guide rowing our way to the lake. Again we'd hoped by opting for the morning session we'd see some wildlife but as with every other tourist attraction we do, a massive group of Ghanaians showed up and decided to sing all the way. But hey, it still looked awesome and I can't say I've ever rowed a canoe through a jungle before! Nzulzuo (the stilt village) is about 40-50 houses all centred around one wide walkway. We got about an hour to wander around it but in honesty you could do it in 5 minutes if all you were doing is walking from one side to the other. In our case however, you could stay all day, drinking in the surroundings! We saw most of the villagers engaging in day to day life, got a talk from the village chief on why they settled there (although this was spoken entirely in Twi so we understood zero, luckily after there was an A4 laminate with an English version on!) and trying not to fall between the gaps in the walkway. One thing we did make use of was the locals trade and how they make their money... distilling gin! One bottle of 80% gin made with mahogany was 3Ghc so 90 pence and it would have been rude not to! I was hoping to bring it home as gifts but when he poured it into some recycled juice bottles without any seal my guide warned we probably wouldn't get it past customs. There goes that 18th present for a certain duo! One more evening in Beyin and our time with Steven and the locals was up. Our next stop was Green Turtle, another resort down the coast but with a bit more luxury which by this point we were in need of. As I speak Jo is typing up that story so fingers crossed you'll get to hear it soon! Until then!\n\nLove Tom &amp; Jo x",

        "contents": "Although we loved Beyin and the lovely locals we met, we were keen to move on to Green Turtle Lodge and to a beach where everyone passing didn't come over for a chat.\n\nHeading off early we had to get three different tro tros to get there, the final one not even getting us to our destination. Crammed into the smallest tro tro to date, and looking like the oldest in Ghana, we were thrown around along a dirt track. As we slowed we thought we'd finally got there, only to look out the window and see a massive lorry stuck in the mud with about twenty young locals trying to get it out. Not put off by this, our driver decided to go straight through the same ditch, and shockingly enough didn't make it!! Time for the mate to get out and push. No success. Eventually we all had to get out, luggage and all, in an attempt to lighten the load. There were times when I though it was going to make it, but knew they'd admitted defeat when the mate came over to ask for our money and told us to follow another passenger. Armed with her baby on her back, a bowl on her head, plus Tom carrying a bucket, the three of us headed off down the road. As we passed through village after village we had no idea what was being said. We can only assume our new-found friend was reliving the story of how she came to have two obrunis with her, to anybody who would listen as she grinned the entire time. Reaching her stop, and having done enough waving at children to last us a life time, we parted with our resort in sight. We had an amazing time at Green Turtle Lodge. I had been there before so was keen to show Tom Ghana's little piece of paradise. Although a little bit rough around the edges this time around and that it was cloudy the entire time, it didn't disappoint. It was set up by an English couple as a turtle conservation site, but fortunately as it's at a secluded beach, lined with palm trees, it's perfect for an eco-resort. We stayed in a lovely little mud hut, but spent most of our time sat on the benches by the bar area, which was made out of a fishing boat. It was here we met lots of other travellers/volunteers/workers each with their own story to tell, tried not to be swept under a riptide in the sea and played a ridiculous amount of card games. It was during one of these games on our first night that a member of staff came over to us to tell us a turtle was laying eggs just along the beach! Rushing along, we suddenly saw tracks in the sand where she'd pulled herself out, and was there digging a ditch in the sand just up the bank. We couldn't really see much as it was late, and even though it was full moon, it was too cloudy to get much light. Nevertheless, we saw her dig a hole, then there was a lot of pulsating as we assume she was laying the eggs. There were times when the red focus light on some people's cameras went off as well, which meant we were able to see her face in more detail and it was incredible to watch. Eventually she fell asleep and we too headed back. Heard the next morning that it took over two hours for her to go back to the sea. Although the food was really good at the lodge, our fishing village mentality on prices meant that on occasion we headed to the nearby village in search of food. We ate so well here on rice, noodles and doughnuts. Massively carb based, but when it costs so little it's hard not to embrace the local diet. However, shelter was not included in the price so when it poured with rain we had to make a mad dash for it and joined a man mending his fishing nets!\n\nHaving spent two days at Green Turtle we slowly moved on. Just so happened that the sun decided to come out whilst we were on the tro tro! Again the journey took the best part of the day and we arrived in the dark in the town Kusamsi of the Ashanti region, with no money and no accommodation booked. Fortunately, the first place we tried had a dorm available (which we had all to ourselves anyway) and wasn't far from an ATM. Plus the walk there meant we found our first supermarket. Am sure it really didn't need to take us that long to pick out water, juice, insect repellent and FanYogo, but as it was air-conditioned I think we were both dragging in out!! The FanYogo went down a treat. It's strawberry frozen yoghurt, and since first having it here we've seen it everywhere and given in many times. The insect repellent was also much-needed, as it was here I counted over 80 bites on my legs! Not fun. Probably an even worse experience for Tom as I kept counting them and taking photos!! Kumasi itself, is mainly known for its market, which is the largest in West Africa. It was here that Tom and I spent our first day, wandering past stall after stall selling absolutely everything. It is used as an everyday market so everybody is out buying their fish and vegetables etc. As an added plus for us, we didn't really get hassled. A few people wanted to wave and ask us where we were from, a few even dragged their screaming babies towards us just to scare them further, but for the most part I think they've realised that we're not very likely to buy groceries from them. We lasted in here for about four hours, armed with only fabric to show for it. We were completely exhausted after this experience that we spent the rest of the day embracing our inner tourist and visited the Cultural Centre. Here we watched how lots of local crafts are created, which was lovely, but in exchange the hassle was back and we suddenly became everyone's 'friend' as they tried to sell anything and everything to us!! Thursday was our second and final day. Partly because we were exhausted, but also because we realised we'd run out of malaria tablets! Time for a quick trip to the Ashanti palace, where Tom was over the moon to get an ebony Oware board (Ghanaian board game, which Tom will more than happily teach anyone who shows an interest).  On a more historical note, this is the site where the current Ashanti king lives, although he has moved into the house next door. Regardless, it was still extremely interesting to see where Ashanti kings have resided since the British arrived. Tired and ready for home, we boarded our tro tro for the most interesting and uncomfortable ride of our lives. Despite Kumasi and Accra both being major cities in Ghana, the road between them is still being built. In patches. Was ridiculous, we'd be on tarmac for a few minutes before the road would just completely disappear. We past countless vehicles that had come unstuck by this. Some of which were having to move their loads onto another van. The road would then be back and the whole cycle would be repeated. Think it was worse because it led you into a false sense of security every time we hit smooth road again. We were so glad to alight, and spent the rest of our time off from BASICs chilling out at our house.\n\nWe are slowly catching up with ourselves. Stay tuned!\n\nLove Jo and Tom",

        "contents": "So last weekend Jo and I headed to a beach just 25km from Accra, called Kokrobite. After our huge week-long excursion the previous week and a very busy time at BASIC's we felt in need of another beach and some relaxation! We'd done the age old trick of not booking anything until a few nights before and so we spent Friday with baited breath awaiting a phone call from a hotel who had said they would call us if they'd had a cancellation. Lucky for us at about 1pm the phone went! So less than 24 hours later, post tro and taxi ride, we got to Kokrobite. \n\n<dl class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><dt class=\"wp-caption-dt\"><a href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/cimg4867.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-106\" title=\"CIMG4867\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/cimg4867.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"448\" height=\"336\" /></a></dt><dd class=\"wp-caption-dd\">The beach and fishing boats</dd></dl>The place is not a \"Traditional quiet Ghanaian coastal village\" but more of a \"We know people like it here so lets build a load of resorts and late night bars village\". We ended up staying at a lovely little set up called the Kokrobite Garden Restaurant which also did accommodation. The place is owned by an Italian family (which meant that the restaurant menu was spectacular!) Our room was a little bungalow (see above) set inside the grounds next to the freshly painted swimming pool. It came with a working, non bucket, shower and a mosquito net! Win! Unfortunately the pool was not ready but hopefully by the time we go again (which we probably will) it will be! We bumped into one of our friends at Big Milly's Backyard who we had met at Green Turtle the previous week. He introduced us to the people he knew and worked with so by the end of the evening there was quite a large crowd of us socialising. We had an amazing meal at the Garden Restaurant... pizza and pesto pasta <strong>YUM.</strong> Big Milly's put on a live band as it started to get late who played weird reggae covers of old pop songs, Bryan Adams to name one I can remember! They were amusing enough and kept a beat well enough to dance to! It was muchos fun! Sunday was much more relaxed with fresh juice and salad for breakfast, with an Italian coffee and bruschetta for lunch. We lounged on the beach as the sun decided to show face today and played yet more Bananagrams. We got told by our friends we met that in a fortnight it was a girl called Harriet's birthday and they are planning on bringing party hats! I think we're tempted to go back!\n\nLove Tom &amp; Jo",

        "contents": "First week of term and Tom and I were given the responsibility of KG. These are the children whose English isn't good enough to go to school yet!! Yes, I know, we are as confused as you are as to why we chosen. The rest of the staff were in training so it was a case of last resort, I guess! Regardless, we had 8 under our care on Monday, which dropped to 6 on Tuesday as two started school, and then to 5 on Friday as one kid was sacked for being too young (and driving Tom and I mad). They were a handful to say the least. Despite us coming up with lost of activities, their favourites still seemed to be; to kick and punch each other, run in different directions, talk in Ga, ignore us and beg to go to the toilet for the hundredth time. The one thing we did manage to teach them was 'pufferfish', and even that they are pronouncing as 'fufferfish' and repeat it all day everyday with hysterics. It was a this point that they were all crowded around Tom as he showed them flash cards, whilst one of the girls sat and plated his hair!! Made me realise their not that bad really!!\n\nDuck, duck, goose also really made us laugh, as it was pronounced either duck, duck, 'gloose', or duck, duck, DUCK. Didn't last long as they shrieked so loudly we were probably disturbing training upstairs.\n\nIt has been massively rewarding though, and despite it taking time to get them to sit down and to put a pencil in their hand, seeing a scribbled out 'a' is a sign they're heading in the right direction. Their attention span is really short though, so the end of the alphabet does get a bit hazy, but at least we've got something to work on for next week!!\n\nAfter they leave at 3pm, we then get the older children once they have finished school. They get a hot meal, help with their homework and then different activities. I've been working with class two, whose English is far better. They are also really keen to learn. I helped one child with her homework and then set her some more questions to check her understanding, and before I knew it I had five others pushing their books towards me to be given more too. One kid even asked me to set him extra to do at home!\n\nOnce they've closed at 6.30pm we then have another hour with the older children to help with their more difficult homework. On the first day I sat next to a girl doing her French homework and quickly got up and moved on to the next child!! I can't remember a thing from GCSE!! These kids are also really great. Most of the children I taught from before are still here and so are in this group. Once we're finished with homework, we tend to just sit and chat. Figure as it's in English it's still educational for them, right?!?!\n\nLove Jo and Tom",

        "title": "The Volta Region",
        "contents": "After another week at BASIC's we decided to check out this Volta region, which everyone had been raving to us about. Not a whole load of years ago a massive dam was created just north of Accra, for the purpose of power generation and a large side effect of this was the creation of a huge lake. This lake now forms the divide between the Central and Ashanti regions and the Volta region in Ghana. We headed north to a town called Hohoe (kinda pronounced like Ahoy) as we'd heard it a good spot to plan and take day trips from. It turned out, we had been told correctly :)\n\nOn the Saturday when we arrived, after a far more comfortable tro tro ride than usual, we dropped off our stuff and left in search of the Wli falls. This particular waterfall is made up of two parts, the upper and lower, although such is the case that in the current rainy season the upper falls are too dangerous to visit. On a brighter note though, the lower falls were worth the long trek anyway. Although there is no official height for the falls, our guide-book placed the lower section as a drop of around 80m! The force of the spray coming out was intense and as there were no indications of safety barriers or anything, we all got in the drop pool and had a good splash around! <dl id=\"attachment_148\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width:778px;\"><dt class=\"wp-caption-dt\"></dt></dl><dl class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><dt class=\"wp-caption-dt\"><strong><a href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cimg4954.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-131 \" title=\"CIMG4954\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cimg4954.jpg\" height=\"336\" width=\"448\" /></a></strong></dt></dl><dl class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width:458px;\"><dd class=\"wp-caption-dd\">Reflection of Waterfall in Sunglasses.

A 45 minute wonder though a rainforest crossing a total of 9 bridges. We took a guide on the way (who seemed to walk faster than humanely possible), but whilst we were there we paid him to leave such that we could enjoy the walk back! Although we saw no large mammals, the amount of insect wildlife was crazy. Butterflies as big as my fist would readily fly close by, sometimes landing on a nearby leaf, sometimes on me!\n\n<dl class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><dt class=\"wp-caption-dt\"></dt><dd class=\"wp-caption-dd\"> </dd></dl>We spent the night at a hotel called the \"Grand Hotel\" which I personally think was a slightly over-rated name. They even went to the trouble of painting the phrase \"I &lt;3 Grand Hotel\" all over the place. Egotistic one might think. Anyway, aside from the inch too short door which I frequently made contact with, the place was fine. We met a couple of Germans at the falls who it turned out were staying at the Grand with us and it made good company in the evening where they told us of their medical placement in Kumasi. One thing to take back from that conversation... don't get ill :D\n\nOn the Sunday we left Hohoe, again on a day trip to another nearby waterfall. This one was much more remote and less touristy, which was one of the reasons we decided to check it out. When we got there we met the chief of the village who we paid a fee, he offered to give us a guide but (stupidly) we thought of the tip we'd have to pay him and so attempted to find the falls on our own. What. A. Stupid. Idea.\n\nAn hour and a half later we got to the falls, after multiple trips up and down the same path, a surprise visit to a place devoted to silence and a chat to a lumberjack having a cigarette. It's apparently a walk that's doable in ten minutes. After all that however, it was amazing. Super amazing. It turned out we had the place all to ourselves as well. There were five stages in all, each stage falling into a pool before dropping into the next. We climbed up to the penultimate pool, which was truly idyllic, a slight overhang was covered by the waterfall into the pool, whilst the pool itself was surrounded by smooth rocks with a sandy bottom. All around the waterfalls and rocks was lush vegetation and not to mention the intense sunshine!\n\n<a style=\"color:#ff4b33;line-height:18px;font-weight:bold;\" href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cimg5029.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-135\" title=\"CIMG5059\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cimg5029.jpg\" height=\"336\" width=\"448\" /></a>\n\n<dl class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">A waterfall we had all to ourselves</dl><a style=\"line-height:18px;text-align:center;\" href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cimg5041.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-135\" title=\"CIMG5059\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cimg5041.jpg\" height=\"336\" width=\"448\" /></a>\n\n<dl class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">Splish splash</dl><span style=\"font-size:16px;line-height:24px;\">We spent a few hours swimming in the waters before heading off to our next stop of the day. We planned to go to a place called Fesi, just outside of a town called Kpando (the K is silent). There we had heard about a cooperation of women potters who had chipped together to run a pottery shed. When we arrived we were welcomed in with open arms where we were able to watch the women work and gaze upon all there creations! What was truly awesome was how they used no machinery, not even wheels, and yet they had some perfectly round, perfectly formed pots and vases. Truly impressive stuff. We ended up grabbing a few souvenirs and ordering a few parts to be picked up in Accra later in our trip. </span> <span style=\"font-size:16px;line-height:24px;\">The evening was spent eating and planning the return leg of our journey. We compared phone numbers with the Germans guide books as ours were out of date but even that didn't work too well. Even our transport plans for the next day didn't seem to fit together too well and in the end we just decided to give it a shot. We'd planned to go to a village called Amezdofe, the highest inhabited place in Ghana at around 800m above sea level. The only issue was that from the north there was a road on our map to get there, but all the locals we spoke to said otherwise... </span>\n\n<a style=\"color:#ff4b33;line-height:18px;text-align:center;\" href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cimg5074.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-135\" title=\"CIMG5059\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cimg5074.jpg\" height=\"336\" width=\"448\" /></a>\n\nJo stood by some leaves on the walk up the mountain\n\n<span style=\"line-height:24px;\">In the end it took a tro tro, a motorbike taxi, and an hour trek up the mountain to get there! It was a crazy journey but as we only had day bags, it wasn't too bad. Ironically when we finally got to the village we ended up paying to visit the summit which was only another 15 minutes or so walk! </span>\n\n<a style=\"line-height:18px;text-align:center;\" href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cimg5153.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-135\" title=\"CIMG5059\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cimg5153.jpg\" height=\"336\" width=\"448\" /></a>\n\n<dl class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">At the summit of Mt GEMI</dl><span style=\"font-size:16px;line-height:24px;\">The best part by far however was our guesthouse. The Akofa guesthouse is run by a gentleman who was born in Ghana, lived in London for 20 years and then retired back out in Ghana. When he told us this it there was no need to ask why he had left London back for Ghana... all that was needed to was to look out off the terrace.</span> The view was probably about 100 miles. From the east border of Togo we could all the way west to the other side of the lake volta.

Last week we were under the impression we were just filling in with KG whilst staff training took place, however as we walked in we learn their teacher was ill. Time to think on our feet yet again!\n\nOur week with KG went reasonably well. There were of course times when we wanted to walk away, but then they'd do/say something to make us laugh and our sanity would be restored. Joe (another volunteer) had brought out kazoos, so music lessons took up a lot of the time. Their enthusiasm wavered at times, but their reaction at hearing themselves playing being played back to them was fantastic, that their was talk of having a little kazoo band! Besides having them write their alphabet over and over, we also played number bowling with them this week. Wish we had photos of this as they got so excited, plus some of their throws needed to be captured! With the older children this week, I had to admit defeat! I looked after class 1 on Monday on my own and they were making so much noise and ignoring me completely, that when another member of staff came over to tell them to be quiet, I had to put my hands up and beg for help. There was only 5 kids! For the rest of the week, when their teacher was back I hid with class 2, whose English is just that bit better to actually be able to communicate with.\n\nOutside of BASICS this week we're had a few problems with our toilet flooding our courtyard every time it flushed (!), so we are now having to use the outside loo. We also went for fufu with Evans, a member of staff from BASICS who lives with us, but was leaving to do his national service in Kumasi. Tom was so excited about trying fufu, as most Ghanians refer to it as their favourite meal. Having now tried it, we do not share these thoughts. It's designed to be swallowed whole, which feels wrong, especially as it's the texture of play-dough! Didn't help that to go with it we were given goat offal wrapped in a piece of skin! In other news, we finally saw what was behind one of the doors at our place. A music studio! BASICS has come on along way! We also took fabric to the seamstress to get clothes made and went to Mercy and Roger's, who I stayed with when I was here before. Was so lovely to see them again, and also see my room!!!\n\nLove Jo and Tom",

Here we were told that despite our stamp in our passports saying 60 days and our flights booked for 63 days, there was a couple of days leniency so we were fine. Turns out the guy at the airport immigration when we were trying to leave 2 weeks later had a different opinion!! But for those of you that have seen us since we've been back, you know it all turned out fine and we made it in one piece!\n\nWith KG this week we repeated the alphabet over and over and over again! It seemed to be going in, but they, like us, were desperate for something else to do. So of course we had to oblige. Managed to fashion some music shakers out of beans and bottles. Made a nice change from kazoos, but in the end we were making so much noise we were asked to go to the media room. Here this led onto musical statues, with Joe playing the banjo. Out of the five children, I had two dancing with me whilst the others watched on in hysterics every time we froze!  One thing I've learnt from that day is banjo music is not easy to dance to!\n\nThe following day, our simple mask idea spiraled into an all afternoon activity with bits of card, paper and crayon everywhere! After a slightly rocking start trying to explain what we were doing and not have them all copy each other, they embraced their creative sides. The final products were fantastic. The girls had bits of hair made out of paper, Rebecca's eyes were very screwif and Jeffery had a mustache and hair all around his face! Even Tom couldn't resist and made his own! The next day the first thing they said to us was 'masks, masks!' Desperate to drag this activity out just a little bit longer, we had them creep upstairs in their masks to scare Auntie Pat. Was the cutest thing ever, watching them tip toe up the stairs, then outside her office all look at me for the nod to rush in and roar at her. Thankfully Auntie Pat played along that she was terrified, making them all very pleased with themselves! Poor little Jeffery loved his mask so much that he refused to take it off walking down the stairs, so nearly fell down them!\n\nWith the older children this week, I was kept busy with activities such as drawing the garden of Eden and teaching spelling words ready for a test on Thursday. Turns out even helping them with their corrections is difficult, as they'd cross out a correct word, or insert words on the wrong line, simple instructions are completely lost when you don't share a language! Plus for their sentences to show the use of the word, it was hard work trying to persuade them to use something other than 'I can'. I realise it works for a lot of the words such as 'I can jump', but 'I can table' isn't quite right!\n\nLove Jo and Tom",

As we were leaving our house, there was the biggest gust of wind ever, followed by the heavens opening! Within minutes our courtyard was transformed into a river. Not put off, we legged it for our tro tro, where we we huddle under a shed whilst we waited. Once on, it didn't get much better, as the only seats left were right at the front next to the mate who was hanging out of the open window!\n\nFinally reaching Kokrobite beach, with our fingers-crossed that the weather would be completely different, we were shown to the same bungalow that we had before. Just as we remembered, so it was perfect. Now that the rain had passed, we were optimistic that the breeze and the clouds would soon follow. Sitting down on the beach, this did not become a reality. Not exactly cold, but still certainly not sun bathing weather. To add to this, Tom had finished his book, so within his boredom made friends with the dog that had followed us all the way to the beach. Unfortunately he then invited all his little flea invested friends to join us. Slightly 'chilly' by this point, we moved to the wooden terrace/platform thing that looks over the beach, and played games until the rest of the mob joined us. Mainly the group we met last time we were there, plus a few extras, we ate amazing pizza, drank Ghanaian beer and danced into the night. Two of the extras that joined us for that weekend were Pat and Allotey from BASICs. After trying to persuade them for ages, we finally won and they took a well deserved and a much needed break. We had a fantastic night with them and all the others, although a game of highest card buys the drinks with James got a little bit out of hand!\n\nThe morning after the night before, and what better way to start than with a full English breakfast...well close enough. Frankfurters instead of sausages and no bacon, but we'll forgive them for this. Was really good. Plus as an extra bonus the sun was out! Cue a day laying on the beach! Was lovely and walking along the beach as the sun was setting was even more spectacular. Love Jo and Tom",

        "contents": "After another week at BASIC's we decided to check out this Volta region, which everyone had been raving to us about. Not a whole load of years ago a massive dam was created just north of Accra, for the purpose of power generation and a large side effect of this was the creation of a huge lake. This lake now forms the divide between the Central and Ashanti regions and the Volta region in Ghana. We headed north to a town called Hohoe (kinda pronounced like Ahoy) as we'd heard it a good spot to plan and take day trips from. It turned out, we had been told correctly :)\nOn the Saturday when we arrived, after a far more comfortable tro tro ride than usual, we dropped off our stuff and left in search of the Wli falls. This particular waterfall is made up of two parts, the upper and lower, although such is the case that in the current rainy season the upper falls are too dangerous to visit. On a brighter note though, the lower falls were worth the long trek anyway. Although there is no official height for the falls, our guide-book placed the lower section as a drop of around 80m! The force of the spray coming out was intense and as there were no indications of safety barriers or anything, we all got in the drop pool and had a good splash around!\n<div class=\"photocontain\"><a href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cimg4950.jpg\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-148\" title=\"CIMG4950\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cimg4950.jpg?w=225\" height=\"336\" width=\"225\" />\n</a></div>\n<div class=\"photocaption\">Us at Wli falls</div>\n<div class=\"photocontain\"><a href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cimg4954.jpg\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-131  aligncenter\" title=\"CIMG4954\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cimg4954.jpg\" height=\"336\" width=\"448\" />\n</a></div>\n<div class=\"photocaption\">Reflection of Waterfall in Sunglasses.

A 45 minute wonder though a rainforest crossing a total of 9 bridges. We took a guide on the way (who seemed to walk faster than humanely possible), but whilst we were there we paid him to leave such that we could enjoy the walk back! Although we saw no large mammals, the amount of insect wildlife was crazy. Butterflies as big as my fist would readily fly close by, sometimes landing on a nearby leaf, sometimes on me!\n<div class=\"photocontain\"><a href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cimg49931.jpg\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-150\" title=\"CIMG4993\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cimg49931.jpg?w=300\" height=\"336\" width=\"448\" />\n</a></div>\n<div class=\"photocaption\">A butterfly on my toes</div>\nWe spent the night at a hotel called the \"Grand Hotel\" which I personally think was a slightly over-rated name. They even went to the trouble of painting the phrase \"I &lt;3 Grand Hotel\" all over the place. Egotistic one might think. Anyway, aside from the inch too short door which I frequently made contact with, the place was fine. We met a couple of Germans at the falls who it turned out were staying at the Grand with us and it made good company in the evening where they told us of their medical placement in Kumasi. One thing to take back from that conversation... don't get ill :D\n<div class=\"photocontain\"><a style=\"color:#ff4b33;line-height:18px;font-weight:bold;\" href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cimg5029.jpg\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-135\" title=\"CIMG5059\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cimg5029.jpg\" height=\"336\" width=\"448\" />\n</a></div>\n<div class=\"photocaption\">A waterfall we had all to ourselves</div>\nOn the Sunday we left Hohoe, again on a day trip to another nearby waterfall. This one was much more remote and less touristy, which was one of the reasons we decided to check it out. When we got there we met the chief of the village who we paid a fee, he offered to give us a guide but (stupidly) we thought of the tip we'd have to pay him and so attempted to find the falls on our own. What. A. Stupid. Idea.\nAn hour and a half later we got to the falls, after multiple trips up and down the same path, a surprise visit to a place devoted to silence and a chat to a lumberjack having a cigarette. It's apparently a walk that's doable in ten minutes. After all that however, it was amazing. Super amazing. It turned out we had the place all to ourselves as well. There were five stages in all, each stage falling into a pool before dropping into the next. We climbed up to the penultimate pool, which was truly idyllic, a slight overhang was covered by the waterfall into the pool, whilst the pool itself was surrounded by smooth rocks with a sandy bottom. All around the waterfalls and rocks was lush vegetation and not to mention the intense sunshine!\n<div class=\"photocontain\"><a style=\"line-height:18px;text-align:center;\" href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cimg5041.jpg\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-135\" title=\"CIMG5059\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cimg5041.jpg\" height=\"336\" width=\"448\" />\n</a></div>\n<div class=\"photocaption\">Splish splash</div>\nWe spent a few hours swimming in the waters before heading off to our next stop of the day. We planned to go to a place called Fesi, just outside of a town called Kpando (the K is silent). There we had heard about a cooperation of women potters who had chipped together to run a pottery shed. When we arrived we were welcomed in with open arms where we were able to watch the women work and gaze upon all there creations! What was truly awesome was how they used no machinery, not even wheels, and yet they had some perfectly round, perfectly formed pots and vases. Truly impressive stuff. We ended up grabbing a few souvenirs and ordering a few parts to be picked up in Accra later in our trip.\n<div class=\"photocontain\"><a href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cimg5059.jpg\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-135\" title=\"CIMG5059\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cimg5059.jpg?w=300\" height=\"336\" width=\"448\" />\n</a></div>\n<div class=\"photocaption\">A women at work in the pottery shed</div>\nThe evening was spent eating and planning the return leg of our journey. We compared phone numbers with the Germans guide books as ours were out of date but even that didn't work too well. Even our transport plans for the next day didn't seem to fit together too well and in the end we just decided to give it a shot. We'd planned to go to a village called Amezdofe, the highest inhabited place in Ghana at around 800m above sea level. The only issue was that from the north there was a road on our map to get there, but all the locals we spoke to said otherwise...\n<div class=\"photocontain\"><a style=\"color:#ff4b33;line-height:18px;text-align:center;\" href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cimg5074.jpg\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-135\" title=\"CIMG5059\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cimg5074.jpg\" height=\"336\" width=\"448\" />\n</a></div>\n<div class=\"photocaption\">Jo stood by some leaves on the walk up the mountain</div>\nIn the end it took a tro tro, a motorbike taxi, and an hour trek up the mountain to get there! It was a crazy journey but as we only had day bags, it wasn't too bad. Ironically when we finally got to the village we ended up paying to visit the summit which was only another 15 minutes or so walk!\n<div class=\"photocontain\"><a style=\"line-height:18px;text-align:center;\" href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cimg5153.jpg\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-135\" title=\"CIMG5059\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cimg5153.jpg\" height=\"336\" width=\"448\" />\n</a></div>\n<div class=\"photocaption\">At the summit of Mt GEMI</div>\nThe best part by far however was our guesthouse.

        "contents": "Hellooooooo people!\n\nA little over a week ago we left on a 17 hour plane journey for the far East, and since getting here we've been non-stop exploring our new surroundings. Luckily for us, we've had Linh, our resident friend and translator, to ease us into the Vietnamese ways! The first day was very short, seeing as we landed at 10pm and mainly consisted of getting through customs, sifting out luggage out of the THOUSANDS of massive boxes going around the conveyor belt, and tracking down our hostel in the Old Quarter. We were reminded of a past time in Ghana whilst looking out the car windows at the sheer talent of people driving around. I think they operate on a similar system of if you ensure you don't crash into anyone in front of you, no one will crash into you from behind. Although the logic is there, it's a tad hair-raising when motorbikes and buses just full on pull out in front of you at junctions (which by the way have no right of way system, you just \"filter\"). Day two saw us meet some of Linh's Vietnamese friends. We ate at a nice Korean restaurant on the edge of town. The Vietnamese, and Korean for that matter, way of eating is based heavily on sharing. You order lots of dishes for the table and pick bits from each to eat in your small bowl in front of you. As far as trying to experience as many different dishes goes it's actually fantastic for a backpacker. The same system doesn't apply to your normal meals in roadside eateries though, as they all only specialize in one type of dish, and only serve that. In those cases, you each simply have your own. We've definitely started to discover what we do and don't like to eat. The majority of dishes fall into the 'rice', 'noodle' or 'rice paper wrap' categories (some falling into two or even three such as 'pancake with rice noodles which you then wrap up') and its only been outside of these which we've discovered area's we'd prefer not to eat. Earlier in the week we went to a specialist restaurant which served snake and although tasting pretty good, there ain't a great deal of meat on them. We also tried frogs legs in a fantastic restaurant which operates in a sort of Vietnamese response to the spice quarter in Leeds. Rather than sit around a square kitchen in the middle, the courtyard of tables are surrounded by stalls which specialise in different dishes. Its table service as normal, but each stall makes the relevant dish and they all get delivered to you. It meant we had a MASSIVE selection of food and every dish is made perfectly! Yum. A lot of our time has been spent walking around Hanoi and discovering all the little nooks and crannies of the Old Quarter. Our hostel is very close to Hoan Kiem Lake which is central to most attractions in the city. There's a Pagoda on an island in the middle of the lake, and plenty of 7th story rooftop cafes offering fantastic views whilst keeping drink prices at around a quid for a coffee. We've also visited a few museums, Vietnamese Ethnology, Fine Art, Ho Chi Min's Mausoleum to name a few. <p style=\"text-align:left;\">One particularly exciting show we've seen was a Water Puppet performance. This is a traditional way of performing with puppets in which the puppeteers stand waist deep in a pool behind a screen. They then control the puppets with long rods beneath the screen which are hidden by the water, giving the impression the puppets are acting by themselves. It originates from when the paddy fields would flood and people had to entertain themselves. Combined with the great music, smoke and lighting effects, it was a really great sight to see. If you search Water Puppets, Hanoi on Youtube you'll get a taster of what we saw!</p> Another activity we were keen to try early on was a massage at one of the many infamous massage parlours  The three of us only opted for a foot massage however what I didn't realise is that they massage all of you anyway whilst your feet are soaking! Jo joked whilst facing the other way that at least she wasn't walking on me, then to my surprise a few moments later, up she jumped! We now plan to head down the coast by train, stopping at all the major 'must see' places. It means we're gonna have either a quiet relaxing Christmas in the town of Hoi an, lots of narrow cobbled streets, small cafes and breath taking landscape... or a rather more upbeat Christmas in the party town of Nha Trang, white sand beaches and plenty of bars! Essentially though, the train times will make the choice for us! Ultimately we aim to be back in Hanoi for lunar new year which is around February 10th to spend it with Linh's family. Her Grandma, who speaks zero English yet constantly nattered to us in Vietnamese when we went for lunch the other day,  apparently wants us to try her traditional cake they eat on new years. Not sure if we're allowed to say no! Anyway, it's currently midday on Thursday and we've got a 13 hour overnight train journey to Hue (pronounced Hway) this evening and to save ourselves about 6 quid we're doing on a seat and not a bed. I. cannot. wait....\n\nStay classy San Diago.",

        "contents": "After our 13 hour train journey, which actually wasn't that bad (although ask Tom and you may get a different answer) we arrived in Hue. Slightly out of the city, we then had to walk along the river from the station to get to affordable accommodation. Only problem was that now that we have moved further south, it is a lot hotter here, making our bags feel a lot heavier! Aside from that and walking around exploring whilst a little bit sleep deprived, we didn't really achieve much on our first day, but instantly enjoyed the change of pace from Hanoi. We made up for it over the next few days. Hue has a lot of old buildings and is rich in history. It even has old walls guarding the city, leading to Tom and I renaming it the York of Vietnam. We walked around the Citadal and Imperial Enclosure for hours, admiring all the old temples and palaces, which have been restored after years of war to their former glory. It is a massive site though, so there is still a lot of work to be done, but likewise we enjoyed wandering around all the ruins as well. At one temple the views were quite different. Lots of bald men, dressed as monks with fake beards glued to their faces, sitting around smoking! Had it not been for the large camera crew and vans full of equipment, I think we would still be wondering now what was going on. Later that evening we bumped into all the crew at a bar celebrating their last day of filming. The main guy was from Leeds, who explained that it was for a Czech bank advert, with a weird story line about following a long beard to Vietnam where your money will be safe! Sounds very random, so will be sure to look it up on Youtube in a few months!\n\nWas a really good night out. Longer than we'd planned though, as the owner and staff of our guesthouse also showed up there too. With the key! Had no choice but to dance to gangnam style until they were ready to head back and let us in! For our last day in Hue, we rented bikes and finally took to the crazy Vietnamese roads. Fortunately, they are a lot quieter than in Hanoi, so we didn't have any problems. Was great to get out of the city and see some more of the spectacular scenery Vietnam has to offer. It also made for a cheap and easy way to visit all the different emperor's tombs scattered around. It's clear to see how much the Vietnamese value their ancestors, based upon the measures they have gone to in order to create amazing resting places for them. They are also designated spaces for people to go to them seeking advice or good fortune. The final one we visited was very different from all the others, set into the mountain. It looked very gothic from the outside, so we were surprised when the main hall was filled with colourful mosaic and a massive bronze statue of the man himself. Was a fantastic day, although we won't be in any rush to see any more tombs/temples any time soon. Nor will we be opting for bikes until our bums have recovered from last time! Next mode of transport: back on the train. This time is was a far shorter route, plus more picturesque. In Hue everyone had been trying to sell us a motorbike tour of this route, selling it as, 'It's the one from Top Gear!' But without going on the steep mountain road, or paying a small fortune, we still got some incredible views whilst cutting through tunnels in the mountains. Also met the people we would come to stay with in Da Nang on the train, and taxi shared to the most strange little guesthouse I have ever come across. The owner Hoa completely makes the place. So much so that there are people here who have stayed for a month, and one guy who came here a year ago and is now back for more! Weather hasn't been great at our first beach stop, but the people more than make up for it. Hopefully once the clouds part we'll be able to head up to the marble mountains and get the view we came this way for! Lots of love\n\nJo and Tom xxx PS Since writing the above it has been glorious sunshine and we have spent most of our time laying on the beach!!",

        "title": "New Year in Nha Trang!",
        "contents": "Hey hey folks!\n\nAlthough Christmas in Hoi An was awesome, it was soon time to move on... We used the bus tickets we'd been given by the Aussie boys in Da Nang and took a wonderful night bus to the beach town of Nha Trang! All 13 hours of the journey was spent in the wonderful comfort of my bus seat/bed, what with its 30cm width and 'not really long enough for my legs' length, oh and the slightly chambered ceiling which had SO much head room.... But hey, at least there was aircon! We rocked into Nha Trang at around 6.30am and due to the impossibleness of sleeping on the bus me and the guy next to me (who from now on I will refer to as \"Malia Man\" as he owned a bar in Malia and we never exchanged names) talked for about 12 hours straight. It turned out he and his girlfriend had been travelling South to North Vietnam, but decided it was far too cold and so had turned around to go back to Nha Trang. This was great as we got tons of info on the best do's and dont's in the city. The best \"do\" was the Indian restaurant that did a 3 course set menu and drink for 120,000d (4 quid) and it was SO good. In fact we ate there twice! We spent around 6 nights in Nha Trang, a few days relaxing on the beach seeing as it was about 27 degrees all the time, one day at the theme park VinPearl Land (which I will come back to as it was SO GOOD), New Years Eve in Cafe's and watching The Hobbit at the cinema and New Years Day at the Thermal Mud and Hot Springs Spa. Man its such a hard life! I'm pretty sure we both agree that one of the best days was at VinPearl Land. If you could imagine a really bad South East Asian knock-off of Disney Land that's full of Russians on a Benidorm-esk type holiday, you're pretty close! The park was split into two, the Water Park and the Theme Park, although it only really took a full day to do both. The park, being mainly aimed at a younger audience had very basic rides such as Carousel's and swinging Pirate Ships, there were two rollercoasters, but on one I thought I was going to hit my head on the overhead spars so we only rode once! The second, the Alpine Coaster was amazing, the point essentially being that you get towed all the way to the top of the mountain on the island and, oh yeh I forgot to mention, VinPearl is on its own private island!!! You need a cable car to get to it from the mainland! But anyway, once at the top of the mountain, the track just winds its way down with loads of drops, sharp turns and blind corners. The catch? You control the speed. Yup. The person in the back (me) has a brake lever and whenever the person in the front (Jo) see's the \"Brake NOW\" signs on the side of the track the person in the back (me) pulls reaaalllly hard on the brake so that we all stay alive on the track :) I'm not even joking. But it was the MOST fun rollercoaster I've been on and the views were spectacular. Being at night, the track was all lit up and you could see the resorts on the mainland with the huge hotels and all their lights. Anyway, enough about VinPearl. The day after was NYE and in the evening we met up with a few friends we'd made in various hostels and cafes in previous days. We played a serious amount of pool, and then as we were outside the bar chatting a group of dragons rocked up and started performing! It was crazy, they were your typical fake horse set up, guy at the front and the back, but they did some mad tricks such as climbing onto a table and doing a backflip off! They were really impressive but once that show was over it was nearly midnight. We'd heard of a bar called The Sailing Club hosting a countdown party on the beach with a stage and band etc, so we heading down. But when we got there it was both sold out and crazy expensive. So we did the natural cheap thing to do, stood on the beach \"next to\" the ropes stopping people getting in and watched the whole performance for free! Rather than pay upwards of 60/70,000d for a drink we bought beer from a Vietnamese lady with a cool box on the beach for about 15,000d and splashed around in the sea until it was 2013! Loads of people had the same idea as us and it was a really great atmosphere. Some people went full on swimming but having stuff in our pockets we thought against it! As I mentioned earlier we spent NYD at the Thermal Mud and Hot Springs Spa. I don't think I've ever been so relaxed! Its set in the side of a huge mountain/big hill so each tub you sit in has some great views. Its pretty weird stuff, I think it's closer to water than mud in viscosity but its grainy like mud so feels pretty nice. And it was really warm too like a jacuzzi! Once our time was up in Nha Trang we planned to move further south to Ho Chi Min City (formerly called Saigon). We're there now but it took another 12 hour bus journey, this time during the day so sleeping wasn't an option! We're planning on moving to explore the Mekong Delta next, which is made up of loads of smaller towns on islands within the maze of rivers and swamps. Should be a ton of fun! Xin Ciao!\n\nTom &amp; Jo xxx",

Day one was a busy rush around in the scorching heat to the must sees and museums. Although as everywhere seems to shut for lunch, there was plenty of time to stop off a little cafes along the way. After a hectic day, we began searching for food and hydration, in what we have now realised was probably the fanciest part of town. Gucci should have been a sign that we should turn around! The prices there were still ridiculously cheap converting back to sterling, but since we're now so used to beer costing 30p and food about \u00a31, what they wanted was insane. Back to the backpacker area for us, for beer and food at the side of the road. At one point the place got so packed, we were actually in the road! Day two was a far more restful, exploring the market and seeing the places we'd failed to see the day before. We also took this time to plan our onward travel, which was essentially look at the map of the Mekong Delta and pick somewhere. Job done. Time to rejoin our new found friends from the bus for a night back on the side of the road. Love Jo and Tom xx",

        "title": "A Brief Encounter with the Mekong Delta (Part 1)",
        "contents": "Once we'd left the antics of Ho Chi Minh city we embarked on a somewhat faster paced, 10 days or so, self made tour of the Mekong. The Mekong delta pretty much makes up all of Vietnam south of Ho Chi Minh and is a massive area of land all broken up with jungle and rivers. A lot of this land has been reclaimed for rice farming due to the quality of the soil, but there are loads of small scale towns dotted around the swampy landscape to explore! In the past, this meant loads of ferry crossings and although this is still the case the further out you explore, most of the main towns are connected via big bridges which speeds things up. We began with a bus to a town just on the cusp of the delta called Ben Tre. A pretty sleepy town in reality so we only used it as a transfer for a night before we moved on. Perched on a river bank (as most towns out here are) we explored the markets and tried a few local dishes before spending the evening in various cafe's. Places out here do a mean ice coffee and Jo is pretty addicted to the iced lemon juices! We had some pretty tasty spring rolls near the market for tea from a woman who insisted on teaching us how to \"mix\" our noodles. Aside from that it was just nice to sit by the river and watch the boats sail past. It was in Ben Tre that my rucksack got slightly heavier as whilst wandering the town we discovered a local music shop! There we bought our new travelling companion, Mickey the Mandolin! Pretty sure that Jo is getting fed up with me playing the same ol' songs on it, but hopefully I'll learn some new ones soon and she can stop pulling her hair out! We only stopped one night in Ben Tre, in the morning we rose early and left for a town called Vinh Long. It was here where we had heard you could see floating markets and experience a homestay with a local family from the delta. Both of these turned out to be true and it wasn't long until we'd booked ourselves on an early morning trip to the markets. And by early, we mean early... The alarm went off at 5.30am and we left the hotel at 6am for the boat! Although crazy early, the sunrise on the river was fantastic! As per usual, Jo took about a million photographs so I'll probably just make a flicker book or .gif image rather than upload them all! Needless to say, it was amazing. We took our tour of all the market vendors floating around. Each \"seller\" has a huge pole on their boat on which they hang the goods they sell. In this way all the \"buyers\" need only to look around at all the poles to know where to go! It's a pretty neat idea although some of the stuff on the poles looked unchanged for a while and not in too good condition! I'm thinking if Asda hung its veg outside their doors til' it went brown they wouldn't sell too much either! The homestay was also a great experience. We got dropped off from the boat tour on the island where our house was. When I say island, the majority of the land in the delta is one island or another all separated by rivers so it's not an island in the sense, isolated out at sea! We rocked up and straight away started to enjoy the peacefulness of the place. Road noise in Vietnam is massive due to their love of the horn but this island was too small for big roads so was very quiet! They had hammocks all over the place and I pretty much chilled out and read my book for ages. Dinner was freshly caught fish wrapped up into spring rolls too which was superb YUM YUM. The only real downside to the homestay experience was that although, yes, we were staying with a real Mekong family, that family had built a massive compound of maybe 15 bedrooms and ran the place similar to a laid back hotel. I guess in essence a better description for the tour would have been \"stay with a real Mekong family... and a load of other guys!\"\n\nTo be continued.....\n\nTom &amp; Jo xx",

We took advantage of the fact we had all the time in the world, and sat in a cafe watching the world go by, trying to hide from the little old lady sitting outside that I was drawing her! We ended the day with pizza, fajitas and nachos, except that's not quite what they were. Pizza was fine, but the fajitas and nachos came out looking exactly the same, neither quite what we were expecting. More like stir fried veg with 8 nacho shaped biscuits around the outside. When we asked for sour cream as on the menu, they brought us yoghurt!! Ignoring what we thought we'd ordered, it was actually pretty good! We didn't stay here long before we were back on a bus. Of course, despite the fact that taxis are very cheap out here, we walked to the station. If I hear Tom say \"I don't think it's that far, we can walk\" one more time, I may strangle him!! Once at Soc Trang, no one could understand that we wanted to rent bikes, so yet more walking to the two pagodas. Was completely worth it though. The first was a bit random, and was filled with hundreds of clay items, all build by one man. The second was more appealing due to the surrounding forest's current inhabitants; hundreds of fruit bats. When we first arrived it was still light so saw them all hanging upside down in the trees asleep. But as night fell they all began to stir and swoop around us. Was pretty impressive, although the only problem was that within the trees we couldn't always see what exactly was close by us until it shot past our faces!! Best view was when we began to leave and saw them swooping around the pagoda with the night sky as a backdrop. unfortunately the photos didn't come out very well, but there are lots of videos to show when we get back! Our final stop in the Mekong was Cau Doc, which most people only pass through on their way to Cambodia. Hence spoken English was sparse and the translation part of our guide-book got used a lot. Got a great view of the city and the surrounding rice fields from Sam (crab) Mountain, which we climbed on day one. Was very good to be away from the noise of the motorbike horns and taxi drivers asking us where we are going, even if it was a very steep climb. The way down was a lot easier and quicker, but that may have been due to the ice cream! Back at the base, a sign that had caught Tom's attention on the way in, demanded another look. Local beer in a tank. The sign said 7,000 dong, but what we weren't expecting was for that to be per litre. That's 21p, and having just climbed a mountain and dehydrated, it's also a lot more than we bargained for! Locals thought it was hilarious as they sat with us, or stared at us as they drove past. For dinner, we continued to embraced being  'local' by sampling random street food. Not all successful, so we ended up eating spring rolls-yummy and reliable! Next morning, and it was a very early start for a boat tour. Cau Doc is known for its large population of people living in stilt houses and floating houses. Best way to see them was on the river and likewise to see the floating market. Much better than the other floating market we went to, this had far more people and a lot more small boats who were genuinely buying their fresh produce for the day, rather than mass trading. <span style=\"line-height:24px;\">We were also able to go onto a floating house and see the fish that live beneath them. Not just accommodation, the floating houses also act as their income. There are large nets under each one, each with thousands of fish in it. The families make fish food, feed them, then when they weigh 1kg they catch them to sell at the market. We witnessed them being fed, and they went crazy!</span> The last stop on our tour was to a minority village just upstream. On stilts also, they showed the markings of the different water levels over the years. In 2010 China built a dam, which is also on the same river, leading to record flooding in 2011. As a community that lives off of the water, this looks to be a reoccurring problem. Well done China!! A whirlwind tour of the Mekong, but we feel like we've seen a fair chunk of the place. Have seen floating houses, markets and crossed what felt like a million bridges. Time to jump on a Karaoke bus back to Ho Chi Minh City for a couple of nights transit, then head back north.\n\nLove Jo and Tom xx",

        "title": "A Sunny few Days in Mui Ne",
        "contents": "Once we'd departed from the Mekong we figured we needed some beach time (it's a hard life, I know!) and we had our sights set on a little coastal town called Mui Ne. We'd actually stopped here before on a 30 minute lunch break during the 12 hour bus journey from Nha Trang to Ho Chi Minh, not a lot of time to do anything, but enough time to know we wanted  to return! The town itself is laid out on a single stretch of road. Originally there was no town, only the road but a guy bought some land, built a guesthouse and over the years the whole town grew purely around tourism. I heard in the beginning the places address' were simply how far along this highway they were from the next town, not sure how true it is! One of the main reason's for its growth is because it's (apparently) the perfect conditions for Kite surfing. If by \"perfect conditions\" they mean, insanely windy on the beach, then yes, I'd have to agree! Most afternoons the sea is filled with Kite surfers. We've taken some photos to try to show just how many there are, but even they don't quite tell the story well enough. I probably wouldn't be too wrong if I guessed in the 200/300 surfers range for the stretch of beach you can see. Although me and Jo are, evidently, natural Kite surfers we decided not to partake this time around due to the $90/each/hour lesson price so instead chose the more creative approach, sitting in a bar, on the sea front, watching the professional's pull crazy stunts and pretending we could do it! Seriously though, some of these guys could hit a wave and be airborne for maybe 7 seconds, flying as high as 10m from the sea! Really impressive stuff. Another of our days was spent on a tour of the nearby \"touristy but actually pretty nice\" sights. The first of these was a place called the fairy stream. Essentially, the terrain around Mui Ne is very dry, desert like sand dunes and scrub covered dirt ground. It's famous for its white sand and also red sand dunes (two separate locations) and the fairy stream seemed to be a place where a river had formed a valley between the two. Our guide dropped us of at the coastal end of the stream and we were able to walk bare foot upstream as it was only a couple of centimetre's deep. On our left was a heavily eroded sand cliff made up of red sand whereas on our right was greenery and plant life. At one section we were able to climb the sand dunes to look down on the stream and it was quite an extraordinary view.\n\nThe second stop (if we ignore the 10 minute break to take a photo of some boats) was at the white sand dunes. Once we'd walked out into the dunes and the road from which we had arrived was out of view, we could have been in Egypt. The sand was so white and clean. Amongst the dunes others had rented quad bikes and such, but most people just looked around in awe. Unfortunately, as with most tours, our alloted time for gawping around at everything was up and it was onto the next place. This time, the red sand dunes. The tour was timed to allow us to watch the sunset here and we did manage to get a fair few pictures, but the wind started to pick up and this resulted in our camera having a temporary allergy to sand and not turning on again for an hour or so! The other real attraction of Mui Ne for us was the food. The fresh sea food was to die for! There was a stretch of road, slightly higher than the sea, which during the day was deserted, however at night, the place came alive! Restaurant after restaurant set up, all with their displays of seafood, both alive and dead for you to ponder over. We made an evening of the one time we splashed out (although it was dirt cheap compared to the UK) and ate scallops, octopus and a BBQ fish. Really nice food and we washed it down with a few glasses of local Da Lat wine, which happens to be the next place we are going to! Love Tom &amp; Jo",

        "title": "Dalat = wine, Buon Ma Thout = coffee...apparently!!",
        "contents": "As much as we love the sun and the gorgeous beaches of Vietnam, it's not all it has to offer. Time to head up in to the central highlands to see a different part of this wonderful country.\n\nIn my head, Dalat was a sleepy little hill-top town with surrounding vineyards, everyone chilling out in their very French influenced villas. It was indeed very alpine-esq. It was not, however, sleepy. The city was bustling, and with the addition of hills (something we haven't experienced for a while) it was a bit of a shock to the system. Still, it was not without charm, and we actually grew quite fond of the place over our two days there. Hit the ground running as we arrived, dumped our stuff and began touring the market, 'Crazy House' and summer palace. Unfortunately, there was one downside, as one of our new friends we'd met on the bus lost her purse. We're not sure if she put it down somewhere or it was taken from her bag, but when she went back to the place we ate, it was gone. Fair play to her though, as she kept her head up and continued to tour the sites with us before rushing off to cancel cards and somehow access money from Lithuania! Cue us doing a little bit of online money transfers to bail her out, with amazing coconut cakes from her as a reward! The crazy house was indeed that. We were expecting it to be a completely gimmick and totally cheesy, but we were not expecting to enjoy it so much. We spent a good hour rushing around this concrete jungle that had a staircase over the roof. There are rooms hidden away all over the place that you can stay in. Considering one had a giant kangaroo in it with bright red eyes, I'm quite glad we didn't. The other big attractions in Dalat are the pagodas. Our original plan was to take the local steam train to one just outside of town, but having climbed the hill to the station, we learnt that the midday one had been cancelled. It turns out they need at least 20 people for it to run! Despite our best efforts, we only managed to recruit one more; Marcus from Argentina. The remaining 17 were a little harder to come by. Nevertheless we'd gained a friend in the process, so the 3 of us jumped into a taxi to option number 2; pagoda via cable car. Views were amazing, as we were lifted over trees and paddy fields. Arrived at one of the best pagodas we've seen, down largely to the gorgeous setting it's been built-in. There is  lake at the bottom of the hill surrounded by pine trees, a beautiful flower garden (that I got a bit snappy happy in) and the ornate buildings were nicely spread out, that if there were lots of tourists there I certainly didn't notice them. In the afternoon, we were at a loss what to do next. Until we saw this... Never realised how difficult it would be, but having someone else's weight on your bike is weird. I did have a go at the front steering, but didn't last long. My crazy zig zags in the road and near misses of the curb, meant Tom soon took over again. I have never gripped handle bars tighter as we went around the round about, that I had the pattern imprinted into them by the time we got off. Our entire tandem experience only last an hour! On our last evening, we finally sampled the local red wine. Other than bottles in the shops, you'd never know that this is what the town is known for. Still, when in Rome...\n\nIt was actually pretty good. Earlier reports from people had led us to expert the worse, and although described by our French friend (whose father also collects wine) as more like syrup than wine, we all enjoyed a glass or two. She did however swear that she would never let her father know she drank it and more importantly, liked it!\n\nOptimistic that the coffee would prove more successful than the wine, we boarded the next bus to Buon Ma Thou. Had a very squashed journey getting here (25 people and a chicken). But the worst part was when we got off to discover there had also been a box of fish that had leaked all over our bags! Smelt SO bad. Was the worst walk to a guesthouse I've ever done. Plus everywhere here seemed to charge a fortune for laundry and because we put all our dirty clothes (which is everything we had with us except one outfit!) in one bag, everything smells of fish! It's horrible. Had to scrub my bag to smithereens in the wet room with a brush and shampoo, because the thought of 10 more months of it and I would have never eaten fish again!! Luckily, it was here in Buon Ma Thout that we found cheese to distract us! Wandering around a bakery we found yummy cakes, breads and randomly cheese. We devoured the lot on a park bench along with a pot of delicious Dalat strawberry jam (classy I know!). Any thoughts about fishy bag were soon gone! To top this off, we walked around town in search for a cafe recommended that over looked a coffee plantation. Not sure if we found the right address or if houses have now replaced the plantation, but the view was a bit of a let down. In true spirit of the place though, it was here that I had my first iced coffee. Must say it was actually pretty good, but as out here the coffee is really sweet, combined with the condensed milk, it tasted more like chocolate...probably the reason I liked it so much! Recharged, we also spent a day at the nearby waterfalls. One would have been impressive enough, but this place spoilt us with two falls, plus two massive suspension bridges. Of course the temptation was too much, and we played the grandest game of pooh sticks EVER! Apparently the fall looks even more spectacular in the raining season, but considering it was a lovely sunny day, I was quite happy to be seeing it when we did. They're both set into a natural park, which meant we could explore as well. Tom even built a little boat, that surprisingly enough actually floated, if only for a few moments! Love Jo and Tom xx",

        "title": "From Quoy Nhon to Quang Ngai (hwee-nong to hwang-nigh I think)",
        "contents": "After departing from Buon Ma Thout, we ventured back east towards the coast. Our route north back to Hanoi ready for Tet needed to be made over a set amount of days and to be broken up enough that there were no crazy 24 hours days on a bus or such.. This is one of the reasons we opted to stop in these two locations. The other major appeal of the two, is that they are both off the standard tourist trail. Yes, that did make them harder to get to, taking public buses and such, but it meant they were both in a much more normal, un-tourist-developed type fashion. We stayed a Quoy Nhon for 3 nights which gave us plenty of time to enjoy its coastal location. As the town is sheltered in a bay of sorts, the waves are minimal allowing some of the best swimming we've done on this trip, and to top it off, we practically had the beach to ourselves! Aside from the sand, the town doesn't have too many of its own attractions. There are a few coves with their own sheltered rocky bays, and a dusty museum which had closed down long ago by the look of it from the outside. We spent one day cycling around these coves however our luck wasn't really on our side as 15 minutes down the road and up a massive hill, the rear gear on my bike pretty much exploded! No more pedalling for me... That meant Jo hot footing it back to the hotel to get another bike whilst I made up as much ground as I could walking to save us time. A good 30 minutes later, we were back on the road! Another feature of the town is the presence of Cham structures dotted around. These are ancient buildings (normally towers) built by the Cham people hundreds of years ago. There are loads of slightly run down buildings dotted around the landscape in and amongst rice fields but a key few important ones have been restored and are really impressive. We visited the a pair in the centre of town and we're able to even venture inside them. The other four we visited required taking a bus the following evening 20km out of town, we found them situated on a hill with some serious panoramic views of the region. At this site all the towers were intricate red brick structures, towering high on the hill with pointy arches and angular features. It was made even better by the sunset casting long shadows everywhere! One fantastic eating experience I feel I must share with you guys, was that when me and Jo tried to get some pretty standard noodle soup at the night market. The stall we went to didn't have a menu so Jo (bless her) tried her best to mime out eating noodles. To our massive surprise, they all seemed to know exactly what she wanted! Lucky us! Lots of nodding and the phrase \"ok ok\" later, we were sat at our table and our meal arrived....\n\nSnails. . . SNAILS! They thought she was sucking snails out of their shells so in front of us, rather than a nice easy dish of noodles, we had a bowl of snails!!! I have not let her order our food since! (Although the snails did taste pretty good, just a lot of hard work!) Quang Ngai was a very different experience. For one, we only stayed a single night, before powering on through to Dong Ha. This was because there was only one real reason we wanted to visit. The My Lai Massacre Memorial.\n\nEssentially during the Vietnam war, a platoon of GI's went rogue and pretty much murdered a full village of civilians. There's tons of controversy about it, some saying they acted on orders from above, others suggesting other motives etc. But the most definitive proof is the American photographer who was attached to the unit and tried to document everything as he couldn't believe what was happening. 513 civilians were killed during the attack. Of that number, a huge amount were either children, elderly, woman, and that includes a few pregnant women. The photographs in the museum by the photographer were pretty distressing and hard to look at. Some of the photos themselves were not gruesome, however the story that went with them is hard to listen to. One photo of an old man, on the floor crying was accompanied with the photographers quote \"The GI's were about to shoot when I shouted stop, I need to take a photo. After taking this photo I turned around as I could not watch and just listened to the shots\". It was apparent that there were a few GI's which weren't following orders as a fellow US pilot managed to save some civilians by landing his helicopter in between the soldiers and them, and threatening the soldiers that he would open fire upon them if they tried to engage the unarmed civilians... I think since the massacre there have been a lot of people tried for war crimes in the US and even one Senate at the time had to step down and do jail time but no one really ever paid for what they did here.\n\nAt the memorial a large statue has been erected and a museum built nearby. In the grounds of the memorial are the actual foundations of the houses the GI's burnt down. A few had been rebuilt back to there original, straw hut form.\n\nOn a happier note, once we'd finished at the memorial we tried out the local specialty in food. Yes it does still include rice. Chicken and rice... BUT they boil the rice in the chicken broth and it makes it taste GOOOOOD! As I said, we only spent one night here and in the morning it was straight on a bus for our next adventure!\n\nTom &amp; Jo x",

        "contents": "Having missed out Dong Ha on our first trip South, we were determined to stop here on our way back up. Am very glad we did.\n\nIt was here that we did a tour of the nearby DMZ and tunnels. Just north of Dong Ha is the river that during the French and American wars divided Vietnam in two. As a result,  it is where the DeMilitarised Zone was formed after the French were defeated, and where the Americans heavily bombed when they joined in after. Consequently, for those people living in the surrounding villages, living underground was the safest option.\n\nAccording to our guide, Quan, lots of families built tunnels in an effort to escape the bombing overhead. Unfortunately, not all were as successful as the Vinh Moc tunnels that we were able to go in. We visited two memorials that mark where bombs caused the tunnels beneath them to collapse. The worst part was hearing that voices could still be heard coming from them up to 5 days later. There was nothing the local people could do, for to gather enough man power it would have taken to dig them out, would have attracted the attention of the war planes and ultimately put their lives in danger too. The Vinh Moc tunnels were the largest of all; 3 levels deep, the lowest at 23m underground and home to 1000 people. They were made from the soil which is rich in clay, possibly the reason they survived the bombing and are still in good condition today. They were also extremely lucky to never be on the receiving end of a direct hit. The closest thing was a drilling bomb that burrowed down a good 20 metres, but never exploded. It is still somewhere in the site today, but has been cemented in to prevent the path it took causing any more damage. Fortunately for us, it didn't choose the day we were there to go off either! <a href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cimg7724.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-398\" alt=\"CIMG7724\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cimg7724.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"853\" /></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cimg7719.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-397\" alt=\"CIMG7719\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cimg7719.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"853\" /></a> Not only were the inhabitant of the tunnel surviving, but they were also actively involved in the war effort. We were shown designated tunnels for military purposes, set up with a 'hospital', meeting room and headquarters. Outside, there is an elaborate network of trenches, with artillery bunkers that would have been filled with supplies from the Chinese and Soviet Union. On the tour, we were also shown the river that divided the north from south, museums, memorials and other locations where key events in the war took place. <span style=\"line-height:24px;\">The last stop on the tour was to the cemetery, where there was a sea of white gravestones. Only a mere handful had names on as no-one wore dog-tags. The rest are all marked with unknown, although some families have had their own plaque engraved and placed them on a grave, hoping that this is their loved one.</span> Our guide was very well-informed, bringing the whole thing to life with real life stories. Seeing the crater where you know a boy of only 14 lost his life certainly makes everything you're being told a reality. The hardest part was thinking about how recently all of this took place.\n\nWith our heads filled with a lot of new information and lots to think about, we boarded yet another bus. This time with a slightly more cheerful reason for visiting our next destination.\n\nPhong Nha Cave is spectacular! It's 55km long, and although we were only able to see the first 1km it was incredible. We took a boat through mountains and paddy field to get there, then entered a massive cavern. I knew it was going to be big, but as we approached the small hole in the rock face I wasn't prepared for what we would see on the other side. There are some lights put up in certain places to emphasise the scale of it and show some of the detail on the rocks, all of which gives quite a grand and a little bit eery feeling. You can also hear the dripping of the water seeping through the cave, making you aware of how it's still growing. We took loads of photos in an attempt to capture some of what we saw, but I don't think any of them do it justice. Here's just a few to give you an idea... <a href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cimg7880.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-410\" alt=\"CIMG7880\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cimg7880.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"853\" /></a> <a href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cimg7947.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-413\" alt=\"CIMG7947\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cimg7947.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a> &nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cimg7954.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-415\" alt=\"CIMG7954\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cimg7954.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cimg7956.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-416\" alt=\"CIMG7956\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cimg7956.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a>\n\nThe town itself that we stayed in didn't have loads going on, so after a couple of days off we went to Ninh Binh ready for Tom's birthday Love Jo and Tom xx",

        "contents": "Happy New Year everyone!\n\nAs has always been the plan, we celebrated Tet (Vietnamese new year) in Hanoi with Linh and her family.\n\nOn new years eve we met at Linh's grandma's house for a big family lunch-time feed. There was so much food, that by the time I'd sampled a bit of everything, I was full! It was here that we tried dog meat for the first time, that Linh's aunt tried to disguise as goat. Was surprisingly alright, just like beef, but I don't think I'll be rushing out anytime soon to try it again. Stuffed, we all retired for an afternoon nap in preparation for the evening's excitement. As it got nearer to midnight, Tom and I ventured out to soak up the atmosphere. At first it was a ghost town. Ever since we've been in Hanoi, I've never seen the streets quiet. Now, in the middle of the day, there was hardly a person in sight. We figured this was because Tet is a very family oriented holiday and everyone was at home. However, it turned out a lot of people were at the lake. We'd been advised by Linh's mum that the lake is where the young people hang out and that we don't want to miss it. <span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">There were two big stages set up down there. The first had a very random variety show on. The reason it was random? They'd set it up on the round about and not shut the road. As it began, motorbikes that had been on their way around suddenly had a change of heart so swerved to park in front. This worked just fine at first, but as the crowd of bikes grew so did the annoyance of the cars trying to get around them. The show itself was actually pretty good. Acrobats, hula-hoop dancing, man balancing large ceramic items on his head! The only act we didn't approve of was the dancing monkeys/throw monkey into the air and hope he grabs on to the little chair. Fortunately we, other tourists and most of the Vietnamese didn't seem impressed by this and didn't clap, so we're hoping another act will get booked for next year.</span> From the other stage there was a lot of noise and flashing lights, so we pushed our way through to check it out. One massive advantage of traveling around Vietnam is that we are both quite a bit taller than the average height. Therefore, trying to see over the sea of heads was really easy! On stage was a large group of teenagers busting some shapes, then in a cornered off part of the road (again which had not been sealed off) were members of the crowd copying. From first sight, it looked like anyone could just walked up and have a go, then move on when they'd had enough. Not so. After a few minutes of watching, the crowd were going crazy, people cornered off were being shown on the big screen and then it all went quiet. Moments later they re-started with a countdown, and then the same music and dance began again. It turns out they were rehearsing for midnight, which with 2 hours still to go seemed like a long way off. A girl from our guesthouse was part of the dancing crowd, and told us the next day how they repeated it and repeated it all night! We are very glad we didn't get involved. With only an hour or so to go, the best views of the fireworks were being snapped up. We began looking, when we spotted an English couple we'd met a few nights before. Plus they had a great view. Bingo! Hung out with them as we saw in the new year. Fireworks were really good, and with a backdrop of the lake, temple and beautifully lit up red bridge, you can't really go wrong! With the last firework set off, so were the crowd in every direction. This wouldn't have been a problem except we had 15 minutes to get to Linh's house on the other side of town. We began trekking it over there, trying to avoid all the people and the hundreds of motorbikes. Despite getting a bit lost, we arrived only slightly late. We made sure we rang Linh before entering the house though, as in Vietnamese culture the first person to enter the house in the new year is very important and usually chosen rather than left to chance. Unfortunately young men are usually deemed as the most lucky, so I wasn't the chosen one :( A little bit puffed, but pleased to have made it, we wished everyone happy new year and sat down to a bowl of rice. At 1 am! It was a bit late for me, but luckily I'm travelling with a human dustbin, so he finished of his and mine! We were then introduced to the next tradition of Tet, which involves everyone visiting the temple. If we thought earlier was busy, it was nothing compared to the streets now, and the temple itself was heaving. Because of the mass of people and the smoke from the incense  we didn't really know too much about what was going on, so we just followed and every now and then Linh, her dad or cousin would whisper something to us about what a Buddha represented. Still, it was really good to be a part of it and soak up the atmosphere. Over the next few days we saw in the new year as we hope to continue it, very relaxed. We had been warned by Linh that nothing would be open, so didn't plan to do too much. Had a great trip to the temple of literature though, where we chose an artist to create a good luck scroll for us. Eventually we had to go against my preferred method of choosing one, as although he was the oldest man there with the best beard, he didn't have the scroll we wanted. (For those of you who don't know, I like drawing old men!) Still, the guy who we did pick, and his partner who wrote the characters, were amazing. We are so pleased with the finished result, that I think it's my favourite souvenir to date. For our final involvement in Tet celebrations we went to Linh's aunts house with all the family. Yet again there was amazing food; even chips, chocolate and red wine to satisfy our western-food-missing taste buds. A few games later and the afternoon naturally progressed onto karaoke! Despite having seen it every where in Vietnam, this was the first time we'd joined in. And joined in we did. Tom's face turned to horror when I reveled he likes the Backstreet Boys' The Call and it was added to the playlist, but when it came on he loved it! I'm sure he didn't even need the words on the screen! However, this was probably one of the only song he did sing, as Linh and I took over the microphones to do a full 'Best of the 90s' playlist! I don't think I will ever forget the lyrics to the Spice Girls! I doubt Linh's grandma ever will either, as she was trying to take a nap as we were belting out 2 become 1! The day was a great way to end a lovely time celebrating with Linh and her family. Unfortunately time was up to quickly, and it was soon time to say goodbye to everyone, and hello to Halong Bay.\n\nLove Jo and Tom xx",

        "title": "A Ninh Binh Birthday and some monkey business!",
        "contents": "<span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">As most of our entries seem to begin, so does this one, with a pretty monstrous bus journey! Ninh Binh is not too far south from Ha Noi, however, it was a good 7 hours from Dong Hoi, our last spot, and those 7 hours were not \u2019comfortable\u2019!! We\u2019d been quoted to arrive in the region of 5/5.30pm which naturally meant we arrived around 7.30/8pm! The funniest part of the journey actually took place when we arrived\u2026 it turned out half of the hotels and restaurants on the road where the hostel we were looking for was, had decided to change their numbering system! This meant a bit of walking up and down comparing new numbers to old, trying to find it amongst all the conflicting addresses. It was all worth it in the end though as the hostel was real nice and a good central location too!</span> The first evening we just grabbed some food in the restaurant next door, Jo had a real juicy burger and I opted for a pizza, a classic western food binge as it was available! Afterwards we explored a bit of the town by night, we found some quite nice market streets and located an internet caf\u00e9 with skype ready for the big day. My actual Birthday began really well! It started with enjoying some awesome cup cakes Jo had snuck into the room the night before! What made it better? They had custard inside YUM! For the rest of the day we explored the real reason we came to Ninh Binh, the limestone karsts! The scenery there was surreal, huge mountains of rock all packed tightly together, the ground between converted into paddy fields being worked intensively by the locals. One way we really got to see the landscape up close was on a 2 hour boat ride up a river. We were rowed around on a tiny boat by this guy who had mastered using the oars with his FEET! I mean this guy was skilled. What I did not expect was to see Jo try to have a go! Needless to say, we didn\u2019t travel very far, let alone in a straight line! Much laughter was had! The views from the boat were spectacular, as you hopefully can appreciate from the pictures. From the river we spotted a temple on top of a karst so we made a mental note to check it out after the boat ride. It actually turned out to be fairly easy to find and what was great was the bike ride to the base. It took us along some fantastic little lanes between paddy fields and small Vietnamese houses. That even in true Birthday style we found a Vietnamese bar which had local bia hoi and peanuts! At a staggering 10,000d a glass (30p) we couldn\u2019t afford to have many\u2026 needless to say, the next day started later than 10am! On another day we rented out bicycles to explore a different section of the karsts. Again, much spectacular scenery was on the cards but the most memorable moment had to be the helicopter flying overhead full of celebrities, in the area to film a tv show, being chased by a horde of teenage Vietnamese girls on electric bicycles! It was hilarious, apparently it\u2019s a popular show in south-east Asia but we couldn\u2019t get close enough to the landing site to find out as the men in black suits and sunglasses had the area pretty well sealed off! After Ninh Binh we had one day in Cuc Phuong National Park. The reason we made the slightly long way round to Ha Noi was the Endangered Primate Centre. This place houses species of gibbon and lemur lookalikes, some of whom have less than 80 in number in the wild! The main attraction was definitely the baby gibbon. I\u2019ll probably lose man points for saying it, but it was pretty cute! Another highlight of the park was a cave which when discovered, housed hundreds of artefacts from the prehistoric era, so will once have been home to prehistoric man. The difference between this cave and previous caves we\u2019ve explored was that no guide accompanied us this time, nor were there any lights inside. Torch\u2019s all the way! It got a tad scary when we were a good 100m inside this cave, after having crawled through a few passages and such, wondering if the batteries were going to last! It was all over too soon and we needed to get back to Ha Noi for the Tet holiday. We took a walk around the botanical garden before hopping on the local bus. That journey also turned out to be pretty eventful, but that\u2019s a story for another day (relating to Vietnamese tyres not being great at \u2018being tyres\u2019)!! Love Tom &amp; Jo xx",

Having spoken to many </span>travelers<span style=\"line-height:1.5;\"> throughout Vietnam who had already visited, we had many conflicting reports of the best way. You see, Ha long bay, although an amazing place, suffers heavily from over tourism. Due to this, you either go with the crowds to save money, and have everything arranged or try it alone but risk massive costs and a not so smooth experience. Being quite \u201canti - tour\u201d we didn\u2019t really want to change our ways but speaking to people who had done it themselves, it really did sounds like a tour was the only way. Looking back on it now, we definitely made the right choice!</span> So Ha Long bay is found in the North of Vietnam, about 4 hours east of Ha Noi by bus (Vietnam timings). it\u2019s a huge collection of limestone karsts, which exist just off shore creating thousands of islands. Being limestone and near the sea, erosion has also created hundreds of little caves in and amongst the karsts. The name Ha Long is something to do with a Dragon and the legend is that here is where a huge dragon jumped into the sea! We opted for a three day, two nights tour, this gave us one night spent on the boat and one night upon Monkey island! We left quite early on the first day by bus, reaching Ha Long bay around 11ish. We were shuttled to the boat by a smaller tug boat and given time to check into our cabins and explore our new home before lunch was served. All I really have to say about the boat is that photo-shop had evidently been heavily used in the brochures!!! Not to worry, the cabins themselves were far more luxurious than any rooms we\u2019d stayed in currently! Lunch was pretty good and straight after we got chance to explore a massive cave. Again the issue of tourism struck with a massive queue up the stairs to get in. It took probably the best part of an hour to get in and once in, again we were slightly disappointed. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the cave was spectacular, it was more the coat of cement the ceiling had been given to prevent parts falling onto tourists, or the huge cement path that now wound its way around the cave! But at least we\u2019ve seen huge natural caves in other parts of Vietnam, that haven\u2019t been tainted too much.\n\nPost lunch we got chance to kayak around a few islands. That was great fun and being in a two person kayak at the back, I had ample opportunities to relax whilst Jo did all the paddling! We ate our tea whilst anchored out in the bay. The surroundings were fantastic, it was great to be able to just sit up on deck and look around. There were also plenty of other tourist boats around, but our boat had plenty of room for the number of people on board so you never felt crowed. And any way, we weren\u2019t there to look at the other boats so your attention was mainly on the place you were at! That evening was when the party started! Although not in the traditional sense\u2026 8.30pm and our guide kick started Karaoke with a b-e-a-utiful rendition of \u2018Hey Jude\u2019. Unfortunately for him people weren\u2019t really in the Karaoke mindset so passed on their turn to sing. We head outside onto the deck with a beer and set about late night squid fishing! This had to be a highlight of the trip. With a simple bamboo rod, piece of line and luminous green lure on the end we shone a torch at the water and the squid just started biting! I caught two in the first 10 minutes then other people started to haul them in! As you pull them out the water they start blasting ink EVERYWHERE which was really funny as it nearly hit quite a few of us. We thought our guide was joking when he said any we catch we should give to the cooks for their breakfast, but we threw them back in anyway just to have another lady on a smaller boat scoop them all up!! Ridiculous!\n\nThe next day was an early transfer to Monkey island, which involved breakfast at 7am, a boat to Cat Ba island, a bus over the island and then another boat to Monkey island. Totally worth it! Monkey island was like something out of paradise! A small island anyway, our cove was the only gathering of buildings on the island. A palm tree lined beach housing several wooden/bamboo bungalows was our home for the next day and night. We began with a trek up to the peak of the mountain from where you could see for miles. It was quite a climb and I was definitely shown up by the dog running up and down several times to my one!\n\nPost summit climb we had lunch, a huge seafood hot pot! Our new guide cooked everything in front of us in this huge stew pot and when our small bowls were empty she just kept topping them up. We were all crazy full but the food was so good!\n\nThe next part was a real highlight, we took a small trek to the other side of the island where the wild monkeys that live there hang out. On the beach they arrive from the forest, I think they\u2019ve learnt that tourists arrive around 3pm and they get food but there are no chains or anything. We handed them some fruit, although one managed to steal our friend Alex\u2019s beer! He was pretty sly about it too, we\u2019d sat down to chat and the monkey snuck up from behind, got the beer and ran to the top of the tree! He then proceeded to drink all of it before throwing the can back down at us! I hope the monkey doesn\u2019t make a habit of it! That evening we had a great dinner and played games with all the other guests. They had a pool table and table tennis which kept us amused until we sat around a fire talking. We knew we had another early start for our transit back the next day but we still stayed up pretty late. All in all, a fantastic visit to Ha Long.\n\nLove Tom &amp; Jo.",

        "contents": "<span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">Arriving 'fresh' from the night train whilst it was still dark, our first priority was to find a room and fast. Amazingly, within 30 minutes we were tucked up in bed, which I think is a new record for us. Once rested, we headed off to explore town. It felt completely different from the rest of Vietnam. Mountains instead of slight hills, cool instead of boiling hot and a lot of the locals were in their traditional dress, making it even more visually different. That is one thing Sapa is know for; the ethnic minorities that live nearby. Just walking around, we were approached by many of the local women wanting to sell us bags, scarves, musical instruments, or to take us on a tour to their villages. Tourism has clearly left it\u2019s mark here.</span> Not put off by the obvious impact that tourists coming for an \u2018authentic\u2019 experience has had, we did fall in love with the place. The weather was mild but sunny, the views of the surrounding mountains were spectacular and it was so nice to be in a place where the main highway didn\u2019t run through the middle of it! An increase in tourism did also have it\u2019s perks; found a restaurant where we ate a four course meal for \u00a33. It was the quietest restaurant I\u2019ve ever been in, the power kept going out, and the woman brought our food in from the restaurant next door, but the food was really good. Nice and warming as the mist was setting in.\n\n<span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">We were very lucky with the weather on our second day; glorious sunshine, that we both actually got sunburnt. We took advantage of this one clear day to climb a nearby mountain to the viewing platform. From here we could see for miles, including Fancipan, the highest peak in IndoChina. Not only this, but for our 70,000 (\u00a32) entrance fee, we also saw a orchid garden, garden of 12 branches (12 animal statues of the different years) and a traditional art performance.</span> We knew our luck wouldn\u2019t last, and over the next few days we hardly saw the sun! Not good when we\u2019d planned a 2 day trek. I could hear the rain in the night and was dreading the state we would be in climbing a mountain in these conditions. We woke up, rented wellies, put rain coats on, protected everything in the backpack in plastic bags\u2026and then the rain stopped! YAY! Ready with our guide and a group of women from the village we were visiting, we set off. Fortunately most of the route was down hill through the valley. This meant that for the brief moments when the mist didn\u2019t obstruct our view completely, we had the most amazing sight of the mountains and tiered paddy fields, which is the most iconic image of the area. Despite not being as green as they could have been (was more mushy brown with pools of water in them), the paddy fields were fantastic.\n\n<span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">At this point we would normally shows loads of pictures of what we saw, except we don\u2019t have very many! This was the point our camera decided to give up on us. This is not the first time, but it\u2019s always come back to life on us. For this trip, however, I think it had had enough. On the rare occasion it did turn on, we took loads of pictures, so although we do have a few, they are pretty much all from the same area!</span> The walk itself was really good, a little bit slippy, but fortunately that\u2019s when the local women would run to your rescue. I had two at one point pulling me up a muddy slope. They were really sweet, and although broken English, we still managed to hold a conversation, if not, then laughing as you slide around is communication enough. We parted ways as we arrived in the village for lunch, when our new found friends suddenly pulled out bags, scarves and jewellery from their bags and set up a mini shop. \u201cYou buy something from me?\u201d and of course, as they had just made sure we didn\u2019t break any bones, we bought a bracelet each. Following on from our feed on rice, we were back on the road. Literally, as the next 3km were a concrete path winding past tourist shops to get to our homestay. Our homestay was very similar to the one in the Mekong Delta, where a family has built a separate structure and filled it full of beds for tourists. Still, we were in the small village, so had a chance to explore. Wandering around, we found lots of rice fields, mud and stilt houses. Am sure the views from here would have been amazing, but the mist had well and truly set in, that I could only just see in front of me. Time to warm up with hot apple tea at a nearby bar! Run by and filled with tourists, of course! Back up the hill to our house, and another trekking group had arrived, taking our total to 10. This made for really nice group to have dinner with, share some rice wine and play a Dutch card game. We had expected the whole trip to be over run with tourists, so were not disillusioned when our experience wasn\u2019t as local as they sell it to you as. Still, we took it as it came and actually had a really wonderful couple of days. There\u2019s no denying that the place is beautiful and the people are lovely, so getting that out of the experience was enough. Day two began just as the first, with a group of local women waiting to catch us as we fall! Off we all set, up and down this time, past a waterfall and through a bamboo forest. I actually think the mud made it more fun! Bamboo is so strong that we were just sort of hanging on to one after the other, dragging ourselves along! Out the other side, we were expected to shop again out of appreciation. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t need anymore jewellery so gave them a tip instead. Back on the flat road, my body could tell it was near the end so was giving up. Was very glad to make it to lunch and then pile into a minibus back to Sapa. Hot shower back at the hotel and it was time to get onto a night bus to Dien Bien Phu, our last stop in Vietnam.\n\nLove Jo and Tom x",

        "title": "Luang Prabang to Vang Vieng ",
        "contents": "Thinking about it now, I probably couldn't group together two places which are more polar opposite than these two. Luang Prabang is a fantastic, picturesque town filled with colonial french architecture and stunning wats. Streets lined with bakeries and souvenir shops in the day give way to the hugely popular night market. Comparing this with Vang Vieng which is better known for its tubing history, it's a key example of a small village upon which the world unleashed a tourism bomb. The number of guesthouses and western style restaurants massively outnumber anything else. The sad part is that since last year when the government cracked down on the tubing (due to injures) and forcibly closed all the bars on the river, the town has become somewhat eerily quiet. There are still tourists milling around, and even now a few more bars have re opened on the river, but there is this huge infrastructure with not enough people to fill it! Back to Luang, we arrived there by bus from Nong Khiaw as we'd 'done' the river and the novelty was quickly fading. Not that the scenery was bad, it just took so long on a small wooden seat, after 5/6 hours it gets painful! The main sights to see in the town were the wats and the palace. The wats, as you can guess are all very similar but impressive all the same, one in particular was undergoing some slight renovation where we saw the monks painting the walls with gold leaf! Probably why the entrance fee was a tad inflated! We stayed 3 nights in Luang Prabang before grabbing an early bus to Vang Vieng, it doesn't take long to use up the enjoyment in absorbing the atmosphere and we soon needed the change. Boy did Vang Vieng provide that! I mentioned tubing, it's the main reason people used to come. The idea is simple, the locals provide you with a big tractor inner tube, drive you 3.5km upstream and you float back down to town. This in itself is an enjoyable exercise, the towering mountains on the side of the river are incredible to watch float by. The alternative version, which got the activity banned a few years back, was the huge amounts of drugs tourists would take before going down the river. Local bars cropped up on the riverside which you would float into, grab a drink and float out. This progressed to the bars setting up rope swings and huge jumps into the river, which is still dangerous if perfectly sober however most people weren't. The other factor in the number of casualties was the river depth changes between wet and dry season, something the bars forgot to mention when they placed the \"dive here its safe\" signs. You can see what happened. We stayed in Vang Vieng maybe 4 nights, it's a good place to treat yourself to a few home comforts, different foods etc. It was also, due to the competition and lack of tourists to fill, very cheap to stay! Our journey to Vientianne next was rather amusing, we thought we could save money by not booking a tourist bus and instead, making our way to the bus station and riding in an oversized tuk tuk. Turns out they're the same price, just vastly different in comfort! It was a nice 4 hours with 10 of us in the back of this truck, I'm pretty sure my knees set into the position I got on the tuk tuk in. T'was rather difficult to move afterwards!\n\nLove Tom &amp; Jo",

        "contents": "For our first week in Laos we saw nothing of the country other than the river, the mountains around it and the villages that have popped up on it.\n\nFresh from the border we arrived at Muang Khua where we got our first taste of our home for the next month. One of the big things we noticed was the lack of people. There are only 6 million people living in Laos, compared to Vietnam's 86 million! As a result there's also a lot more untouched land, and the land is beautiful. I was really surprised how visually stunning northern Laos is. Although not much going on in this small village, it acts as a central hub for a lot of other surrounding villages. This meant a  mixture of different traditional dress wandering around the town, which, combined with a stunning mountain backdrop and life happening on the river, made for exciting viewing. I think most tourists don't stay long here, using it only as a base for onward travel. We gathered this because the woman who ran our guesthouse was so glad we stayed two nights that she gave us free water and sticky rice! It was here that we also met our Swiss friend Loris, who we should really call Laos-ris (!) as from this point on we spent pretty much the whole of Laos together! <a href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/cimg9223.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-527\" alt=\"CIMG9223\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/cimg9223.jpg?w=300\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n\nTo arrive at our second river side village, the only option was to go by boat. Although five hours sat on an extremely uncomfortable plank of wood, this was a spectacular journey. The scenery altered with every bend in the river to be more stunning than the last. It also turned out to be a far more exciting journey than we'd planned due to the odd rapids here and there, and the addition of a goat and three pigs. They were not happy about coming aboard our pretty small boat, especially the pigs who managed to jump back out again nearly drowning themselves. Turning the bend in the river we saw Muang Ngoi Neua straight away, lined with river view cafes, bungalows and of course tourists, we knew this was our stop. There's no other way to really describe this place other than idyllic. The boys did very well in their hunt for accommodation (I did the selfless act of 'guarding' the bags) and we landed ourselves two bungalows overlooking the river slightly away from the centre of town. Hammocks outside and west-facing. Cue more spectacular sunsets behind the mountains. Whilst here, we also ventured slightly further afield into local villages. It was a long and sweaty day, but completely worth it. We crossed rice fields, rivers and had to do a few detours to avoid herds of water buffalo. All of this to see a waterfall, secluded stilt village and a couple of caves, one of which was so remote we spent most of the journey debating if we'd gone wrong somewhere. Our last stop along the river was to Nong Khiaw (a lot of new names, which I only know because I'm reading them!) This place is much bigger than the previous two that it had electricity all the time! Just as we were about to set off to explore yet more caves, we heard from a couple we'd met in Halong Bay, and as luck would have it, they were in the same town, just a few doors down! Cue the reunion and catch up in the caves! Was a fantastic end to our first week in Laos along the river. Love Jo and Tom x",

My knowledge of what happened here should, I guess, be a lot more extensive as we visited the museum and a few of the key sights, only most of the signs are in either French or Laos, somewhat hindering my understanding! From what Jo and I can gather, there was a lot of fighting and it centered around a big hill in the middle of town! The whole place had a sleepy feel to it, which, was a really nice way to end our time in Vietnam. We took our time to sample a few classic Vietnamese dishes which we knew we wouldn\u2019t be able to have again, and enjoyed being able to speak the limited vocabulary we\u2019d learned over the past three months to the locals. As soon as we crossed the border, we knew we'd lose that luxury! The crossing itself was really easy, we took a nice early bus at 5am to the border. We were stamped out of Vietnam (apparently a day in the past as they\u2019d not changed the stamp from yesterday!) and we were on our way to Laos. All border issues aside, the road between the two countries was amazing, snaking its way through the mountains and valleys that make up the region! There\u2019s a fantastic line in the guidebook which says something like \u2018If a greater being took a sheet of green paper and crumpled it up creating sharp peaks and big valleys, that\u2019s northen Laos!\u2019 This road on the way across certainly gave us the same impression. We got to the Laos side early morning and paid all the little \u2018extra\u2019s\u2019. It was quite amusing having to pay an \u2018official\u2019 3000kip (20p) to take my temperature to ensure I didn\u2019t have bird flu! Luckily for me, and Laos, I didn\u2019t! And that was that. End of Vietnam, the place we\u2019d called home for 3 months. Although we were so close and the boundaries are purely political, the distance was only 200km from where we slept last night, it had a very strange feel to it! But never the less, we were ready to explore a new place! Hello Laos\n\nLove Tom n Jo &nbsp;",

        "contents": "No trip to Laos would be complete without a visit to Vientiane, the capital. It was time to get back into the swing of touring all the attractions and historical sites, plus it was the perfect place to run some long put off errands. We finally bought a new camera!\n\nThe city itself is nice enough, nothing especially exciting, but certainly has enough to fill maybe a day or so. We managed to have an action packed day doing as much as possible. We started of at the Presidential Palace, then onto two of the most historically significant wats (temples) in Laos.  The first had over 10,000 Buddhas in and the second used to house the famous emerald Buddha, which the Thais then stole! The rest of the day took a sight detour when the place we wanted to go to was shut for national women's day. Cue a local bus journey in the Buddha park. It really was a day full of Buddhas! The Buddha park is exactly that, a park with loads of different concrete Buddhas in every shape, size and position. The best part was the giant dome, which you can climb to get a good view of the whole park. Combine this with the fact it was a national holiday so full of families running around, it was a really good afternoon. The next day we finally made it to the COPE centre, which had been shut before. The visitors centre attached to the clinic, highlights the ongoing problem of un-exploded bombs in Laos. Laos is the most bombed country in the world and yet it's a war that is often forgotten. If a plane carrying bombs intended for Vietnam had a change in order, rather than attempt landing and risk it blowing them up, they would cross into Laos and drop it anywhere. This combined with intended bombing to stop any assistance to the communist Vietnamese, has led to a large portion of Laos still being a danger zone.\n\nCOPE attempts to rehabilitate people through prosthetics and physiotherapy. They are also involved in education programmes to stop people going looking  for scrap metal, which unfortunately now comes with a price tag big enough that people are knowingly taking the risk. The stories we heard were horrific, especially involving children who simply copied what they saw adults doing and hoped they would bring back  some money to support their families. Although harrowing, it was a very interesting place that was very well thought out. Tom and I both tried on a prosthetic leg and realised how difficult it is to balance let alone walk.\n\nIt was also in this city that our netbook charger blew up! We thought we'd found an amazing deal with the hotel we were staying at, because it was still being built, they offered us a room at a largely discounted price. It's still probably the best room we've stayed in but there was the hidden charge of a power surge causing the charger to spark! Thankfully the netbook wasn't plugged in. Time for us to spend an entire day traipsing around the market looking for anything remotely close to what we needed. Needless to say, it was a pretty awful day where everything seemed to go wrong. No new charger, but we did leave with a brand new camera that hopefully you'll be able to notice the difference in quality of our photos! Pleased to be leaving, our next stop was a flying visit to Savannakhet. The only thing that's really there is a dinosaur museum!! So random, and pretty small, but it turned out that the area has been the place of discovery for a lot of our prehistoric friends. In 2012 they even discovered a whole new 'breed' (not sure of the technical wording!) and incidentally called it the Laosensis!! I've never thought of myself as particularly interested in dinosaurs, but being shown such recently discovered bones was pretty exciting. We were even taken to the laboratory out the back where they were still making casts of all the bones. No glass, just the guy holding up millions of years old bones just inches from my face. That was pretty cool. Good old Laos is full of surprises!\n\nLove Jo and Tom x",

        "title": "Kratie and Phnom Penh",
        "contents": "Hello and welcome to Cambodia!\n\nAfter a lovely hassle free *cough two hour wait at the border* we rocked up into our first Cambodian town, Kratie. A very small town on the riverbanks of the Mekong, Kratie's main draw is the very rare fresh water dolphins found only in a stretch of the Mekong. What is so appealing about Kratie is 'how' easy it is to see them and virtually every trip out onto the river will result in some great sightings of the water dwelling mammals. Unlike the dolphin we're all used to seeing, Kratie dolphins (called Irrawady dolphins) have a large bulbous head and no snout. On the evening we went out to see them, we saw plenty of dolphins however our photography skills not quite being up to scratch meant a lot of photos that look like this (see below..). After a few nights in Kratie we moved onto Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. Being a very bustling settlement, it was at first quite overwhelming due to the size of the previous towns we'd been in for the past few weeks! We'd met a couple during our time in Kratie and also taken the same bus down to Phnom Penh so upon arrival decided to hunt down a room together. This ultimately meant me and Chris leading the way claiming superior knowledge of Phnom Penhs roads and guesthouses from the few minutes  of reading the guidebook, and the girls following behind. About 45 minutes later, no decent guesthouses found, the four of us nearly dying of dehydration and having looped an area of town known for its high caliber hotels, we figured a break was necessary! After some quick hydration in a local drinking establishment, $1.5 for a pitcher of Angkor, we were ready to tackle the roads again. No sooner than 5 minutes later were we settled into our new home for the next four days! The main sight or activity in Phnom Penh, if you can call it that, is to visit S21 and the killing fields. These are brutal reminders of the Pol Pot regime which, if you know your history, was a very dark time indeed.  We chose one day where we would visit each site, S21 in the morning and the killing fields in the afternoon, and bartered with a tuk tuk driver to sort out the transport. S21 is one of the torture centers of the regime where suspected spies and ultimately, lots of innocent civilians were taken for 'questioning'. The only people that survived S21 were the prisoners still alive when the Vietnamese stormed the city and freed them. Everyone else who entered the doors either left already dead, or on a truck to the killing fields. What makes the place even more harrowing is that it is a converted old school building, you walk though classrooms which have seen so much bloodshed the white tiles are stained a yellowy brown. Outside, the frame normally used for exercise and rope climbing, turned into a gallows. At the killing fields the story doesn't get any better. The center provided us with audio guides so as we walked around, looking at the mass graves and bones on the ground we could hear explanations and real testaments from both family members and soldiers there. Very chilling. When the people were loaded off the trucks they were made to kneel, one after the other at the edge of a pit before being bludgeoned by a soldier, bullets are expensive. If you survived that then the next soldier in the pit would probably slit your throat and then to top it all off, DDT was sprayed onto the graves to reduce the smell of decomposition, but would serve also to finish off any survivors. Even with all that, the most, utterly horrifying act was seeing a tree covered in bracelets and offerings to remember the dead by. This tree was used by soldiers to smash babies against before throwing them into the pits with their mothers. Needless to say, it took a long time to absorb this information even more to believe other humans are capable of it. In the centre of the fields there is a huge memorial, a glass walled stupor which houses some 4000 skulls and other bones. As the ground there is quite soft, every rainy season brings a few more bones up to the surface, or rags of clothes etc. To bring the blog onto a lighter note, it was in Phnom Penh that we bought a new laptop charger (yey) which is why you've probably witnessed a surge in the number of backdated entries from Laos, which is where our last one exploded. Hopefully with this one we shall have more luck!\n\nBeing quite close to Jo's birthday now, we decided to head to the coast  so she could have a beach birthday. Next stop, Kampot!\n\nLove Tom &amp; Jo\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

As there wasn't much else to do here, I took this opportunity to give Tom a haircut to stop him complaining how hot he was!! All we had were a pair of tiny nail scissors and a comb, which is probably why it took an hour and a half!! Just a short tuk tuk and boat ride away from here, was a small island we called home for one night, Don Kho. This has been the only homestay we have done that I would actually consider a homestay. It was a small village of stilt houses, one of which belonged to our surrogate family. We got to eat with them, work with them and  sleep in their spare room that was actually part of their house (unlike other ones we''ve done). The best thing about all of this, was that the family makes their money through silk weaving! Having read about this place in the guidebook, the silk weaving element was probably the reason we ended up going. I really wanted to give it a go. Following on from a fantastic meal of smoked chicken and sticky rice when we arrived, I was quick to show my interest. The woman was a fantastic teacher despite only being able to say \"weaving, weaving, bang bang\" in English. I loved it straight away but I wasn't, however, expecting to be doing it for the next two hours!! Even Tom had a go, and later became in charge of controlling the pattern whilst I weaved. Realising we hadn't seen much of the island, we took a walk in the afternoon. Other than seeing people asleep in the shade of their houses, we didn't really see anyone else walking around. After about ten minutes in the blazing sunshine we realised why! It was crazy hot. Luckily the island is tiny and it didn't take us long to do a loop. The most exciting thing we saw was a long, brown snake not too far away from us. Luckily he was more afraid of us and soon scarpered! Back at 'home', we sat by the fan reading and generally enjoying the slower pace of life that is the norm here. That was until our 'mother' stopped weaving herself and insisted we carried on whilst she made dinner! The strips that we were weaving can be seen all over Laos, and are used as the trim of the traditional Laos skirts. <span style=\"line-height:1.5;\"> Needless to say, by the end of the day a lot of weaving had been completed four strips), although I'm sure if we hadn't have been slowing her down she would have done twice as much. There also wouldn't have been an errors in it! Opps! Regardless of this, we are immensely proud of what we have achieved and bought the piece we'd been working on as proof of our efforts. If I do say so myself, it is beautiful. Definitely one of my favourite souvenirs of the trip, to remind me of one of the best days. </span> Love Jo and Tom x",

The town itself is tiny, one road with amenities along each side. We managed to bag a great bungalow in a really central location, not that any bungalows we're really that far out of town but still, we we're next to the best restaurant! Mama Pap's, I wouldn't like to guess at how many times we ate their vegetable curry and sticky rice, or baguette with eggs and coffee, or even the immense chicken sandwich. The real draw was her though, she was so sweet and didn't seem to ever stop working even when we tried to get her to take a break. If you've never seen a lil' 60 year old lady effortlessly grab a huge crate of Beer Lao off the back of a motorbike without breaking a sweat, and then delegate a customer (occasionally me) to fill the fridge with the warm bottles, its a pretty funny experience!\n<div><dl id=\"attachment_505\"><dt><a href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/p1040834.jpg\"><img alt=\"Some local waterfalls\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/p1040834.jpg?w=640\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a></dt><dd>Some local waterfalls</dd></dl></div>\n<div><dl id=\"attachment_506\"><dt><a href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/p1040864.jpg\"><img alt=\"A huuuuuge waterfall we walked to!\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/p1040864-e1365564006372.jpg?w=640\" width=\"640\" height=\"853\" /></a></dt><dd>A huuuuuge waterfall we walked to!</dd></dl></div>\nThe real draw though was the surroundings, Tat Lo is situated in a very rural part of Laos. In the season we went, dry rice fields and meadows fanned out from the village, following the curve of the river, carving shallow gorges and valleys everywhere. On one particular day we set out to walk to a huge waterfall nearby, worshipped to some extent in the local communities, Tat Suong. It took a full morning to walk the 3/4km or so as the trails through the fields and such were hard to follow. We also wanted to take care as the UXO (Unexploded ordinance) threat here is pretty high if you wander off the trails, something we wanted to ensure we didn't do. Arriving at the falls was a very powerful feeling, although there was only a tiny stream at this time, from the size of the cliff face you can feel its potential. There were a couple of paths to the top and one allowed us to peek out half way up!\n<div><dl id=\"attachment_504\"><dt><a href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/p1040820.jpg\"><img alt=\"Elephants!!\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/p1040820.jpg?w=640\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a></dt><dd>Elephants!!</dd></dl></div>\n<div><dl id=\"attachment_503\"><dt><a href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/p1040807.jpg\"><img alt=\"Nom nom nom!\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/p1040807-e1365564276643.jpg?w=640\" width=\"640\" height=\"853\" /></a></dt><dd>Nom nom nom!</dd></dl></div>\n<div><dl id=\"attachment_502\"><dt><a href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/p1040756.jpg\"><img alt=\"One, two... three elephants!!\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/p1040756.jpg?w=640\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a></dt><dd>One, two... three elephants!!</dd></dl></div>\nThe other major attraction of Tat Lo for us was the elephant rides! A lodge there has 3 elephants and luckily, due to a good eco tourism ethos, they looked very well. We'd heard stories of mistreatment but this place seemed to feed them very well (which we got to see) and the  riders didn't use the dreaded hooked stick for disciple (the elephants had no visible scars). Our ride took us around an hour through local villages, forest trails and across a few rivers. Its lucky the elephant knew what she was doing as I couldn't see the rocks under the water she was standing on!

This place, not obvious from the town itself, used to be the capital of the Champasak region. The reason being, the huge Wat built into the mountainside. Wat Phu Champasak was a seat of royalty many years ago, when an old road connected it to the city at Angkor! The architecture was very similar, and almost a bit Mayan in the stepped pyramid sense and it climbed the mountain. We spent the afternoon exploring the ruins, and even saw this massive lizard!

Most of the islands are more like hedges that can be seen when the river level is low. Fortunately we were in luck, and it was the ideal time of year to see this spectacular landscape. Although there were many islands to chose from, we spent most of our time on Don Det. It is very well set up for tourists with bars, restaurants and shops, meaning we slightly out number the locals. However, as it's so beautiful, it's not hard to understand why the masses have landed there. As it was so hot there you couldn't really do very much during the day, and nights were equally as humid. Even finding a room when we first arrived took far longer than it should have, and sufficiently wiped us of energy for the rest of the day! Likewise, for the other three days we did very little besides eating well, swimming in the river and chatting to new friends. We did have one jam-packed day of exploring, and rented bikes to visit the neighbouring island. The main attractions are the two waterfalls, which are ideal for a quick dip after cycling in the mid-day sun. The second of which was spectacular, made up of lots of different waterfalls all feeding into one. We took countless photos as every corner showed a completely new view.

        "title": "To the beach!!!",
        "contents": "Once we'd got the taste of the beach on Jo's Birthday we got really excited about the south coast of Cambodia! The main place to go is a town/city called Sihanoukville. Perched right on the coast, on a  peninsula surrounded by islands, it boasts about 5 or 6 different beaches, each one attracting a different type of clientele. Seeking the two opposing attractions of isolation on a crisp white sand beach, hammocks and crystal blue waters, with an awesome party atmosphere, good people and decent prices, we opted to stay on a beach called Otres. <span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">Otres is about 5km to the east of the main tourist strip. Although it still has a fair few resorts with bungalows and restaurants, it's no where near as over crowded and western as the main strip of Serendipity beach, however for a short tuk tuk ride, the parties were just around the corner!</span> Otres was amazing, we found a room right on the sand which lead to me spending a fair proportion of each day pretending to be a fish and hardly leaving the sea (we even bought a snorkel so I didn't need to surface all that often!). The sea life was amazing and from my sightings of a colorful jellyfish, shoals of normal fish and an octopus, all within 10 metres of the shore, we decided to go out on a snorkel tour to a few of the reefs on the nearby islands. Well, they blew my mind! From the second we got into the water the variety and abundance of sea life was astounding. We'd been warned about the sea urchins but I never imagined they were so huge! We're talking a body the size of a tennis ball with the spines reaching out to a large basketball size! The fish were in their hundreds, darting around coral and glimmering in the rays of the sun coming in through the water. It's a real shame water and electronics don't go hand in hand otherwise I could bombard you with some amazing photos, as it happens you'll just have to think back to those David Attenborough programs and imagine I'm there!! What gets me really excited is one of the other guys on the tour had come from the Thailand islands and was really unimpressed with the reef, he says if I found these reefs amazing I may die of a heart attack when I see the ones surrounding the Thai islands! Guess I better prepare my defibrillator!! After the sensory overload of the snorkel tour day (and the unfortunate side effect of pretty bad sunburn on my back from laying face down in water all day) we took it easy the next day and had a trip out to the local national park. A few friends in Laos who come through Cambodia had recommended it as when they'd visited they'd seen flying squirrels. Me and Jo found this too good an opportunity to miss although we had a stroke of bad luck and didn't see any. I think it has something to do with the guide's dog that went 10m before us on our trek scaring/eating anything we were likely to see :( To be honest, the only bad thing about Otres was that it was so difficult to leave. It was really easy to wake up, have breakfast and a coffee overlooking the islands from the beach, wander around, swim etc. Have dinner by candle light on a table in the sand with the sea, literally lapping at your feet. We met some really good friends on the snorkel tour and proceeded to hang out with them most days and were often surprised when checking the time to find out it was 4pm before you'd even done anything that day! After a week of paradise we knew we had to move on or we never would and a really big push was that we have Angkor Wat in the pipeline. Not wanting to run out of time on our visa, we booked a bus, said goodbye and set off to our intermediate stop before Seim Reap, Battenbang.\n\nLove Tom &amp; Jo",

        "title": "Beach Birthday in Kampot and Kep",
        "contents": "From the hustle and bustle of the city, we moved towards a slower pace of life in Kampot. About 45 minutes away from the coast, with a river running straight through the middle of it, this sleepy little town was just what we needed. Found a fantastic base to make home for the next few days, and got into the flow of things by not really doing very much. We sat in one cafe on our second day for about four hours! I was busy drawing the king on the Cambodian currency, and then had to repeat it when the women in the cafe wanted one to go on the wall! If anyone is ever in Kampot please go and see if they ever did put it up! Tom, however, was busy touring around the tiny town on a 'secret mission', although he did keep asking me what I wanted for my birthday. I wonder what he could have possibly been up to! Later that day, the eve of my birthday, we took a trip down the river. There was six of us in total, all lounging on deck chairs, drinking beer and watching the sunset. It really was beautiful as it is surrounded by mountains and small villages, made even better by our new boat buddies. Went for dinner after with two of them, and dinner on my birthday with the other two! Sunday 31st March and it was my birthday!! Yay!! Woke up very excited and also  ridiculously early! Our bus to take us to the  beach was picking us up at 7.40 am. Combine this with allowing time for birthday cake and candles, cards and presents, and it was probably one of the earliest birthdays I've ever had!! Completely worth it for the bottle of wine, kettle chips, cake and jigsaw birthday card from Tom. Plus I finally got to open the birthday card from Becky that I've been carrying around for 4 months and been trying to peak at! Made it to Kep, at the coast and headed straight to the beach and into the sea. It was warm!! Hottest sea I've ever been in. I think it's because it's a bay, so the water has had time to warm up, which means it's also really salty! We could have happily stayed there all day, but we realised it was probably best to do the walking parts of our plan whilst it was cooler/not as crazy hot. Found the local crab market for breakfast and  then walked up a nearby mountain to get incredible views of  the bay. It was at the sunset rock that Tom and I enjoyed my birthday presents. Only problem was he'd bought a corked bottle of wine! Cue Tom breaking into it with the buckle of his belt and a stick!! In his defense, he only poured about a third of it all over himself, and it was delicious!! With all this walking in the boiling sunshine, it was a pretty hot and sweaty day. This meant we really did appreciate getting back into the water, even if we did have to swim half way out to sea before we cooled down!! Compared to the morning, the beach was now a hive of activity with Cambodians everywhere. It was the perfect way to end the day; swimming in the sea, laying on the beach, and people watching. All the while Tom dug a hole and scared off local, naked children who tried to jump in it!! Good old Tom makes friend where ever he goes! Soon it was time to get back on the bus and head home. A quick turn around to de-sand, and we joined our South African boat buddies for dinner. There was double reason to celebrate that night, as they had just learnt that they'd become grandparents again! We all celebrated with an amazing dinner of pork ribs, mash potato and the odd glass of beer. A fantastic way to celebrate my birthday Cambodian style!! Love Jo and Tom x",

        "title": "All Aboard to Battambang!",
        "contents": "We had heard many mixed reviews about Battambang, but decided to stop for a visit nonetheless. We loved it! This may have been because we found four exciting things to do, so had jam-packed days, because we liked the feel of the chilled out little town, or because we found a restaurant that we loved and ate almost every meal there!!! What ever the reason was, we would highly recommend a stop in good old Battambang! Our first day, and first activity, started out in a tuk tuk and a torrential downpour!  Stopping under trees and rushing to hide with locals was actually a lot of fun, but luckily of us it stopped just as soon as it started and we were able to continue on bone dry! Our destination was to a local winery, which is one of the only ones in Cambodia. Wine is something you hardly ever see, and even then it's usually imported. We paid a couple of dollars each and were given a taster of their red wine, red grape juice, ginger juice and brandy. It was actually pretty good, that was until we got to the brandy! Not something I'd be rushing to try again any time soon! We were, however, impressed enough with the juices, (and they came within our budget) that we bought a bottle of each before we were on our way again. Next stop was to a nearby mountain, which has a temple on the top, but is also known for its involvement in the horrors of the 1970's. There are many caves within the mountain, two of which were used to throw 'undesirables' into during the Khmer Rouge. One for men and one for women and children. Just like in Phnom Penh, there is a memorial here with the bones of those that lost their lives. It's a pretty eerie place, which is probably why we didn't stay long. On a happier note, there is another reason to visit the caves. Bats! One of the caves within this mountain, is home to an estimated 10 million bats!! We rushed down from our look around the temple just before 5 pm, when we'd heard the show started. They were slightly behind schedule due to the rain, but it certainly didn't disappoint. At first there were just a few bats circling the entrance, then, randomly, as if one bat had decided now was the time, they all began to fly out in one massive line!!! It was incredible!! Glancing up, it looked like a solid black line flying over our heads, but on closer inspection you could make out every individual bat simply following the one in front of it! We took loads of pictures, and also have a fair bit of film footage, just trying to grasp some degree of what we saw, but I doubt it does it justice. It certainly was a sight to behold! Talking to our tuk tuk driver, we learnt that it takes them a whole hour for them all to leave the cave. Thankfully we didn't wait to watch the entire thing, but we did stop on our journey back to watch as they flew in swirls over some fields. Tom described it as like incense blowing in the wind, all wispy and random. Phenomenal.\n\nDay two, and we set straight off for the big attraction of Battambang. During the French rule a train line was built in the area as a link between cities, however, with war and unrest that has occurred in Cambodia, there haven\u2019t been any trains for years. Well\u2026in the traditional sense! Being as resourceful as they are, some local Cambodians continued to use the train line with their hand made bamboo trains! With some metal rollers that fit onto the track, metal frame covered in bamboo and a motorbike engine, these carriages fly up and down the track connecting small villages. They were originally used to transport people, cattle and anything else that needed relocating. Only problem is that there is only one line, if something is coming the other way it\u2019s all hands on deck. The people from the lighter train get off and the whole thing is disassembled then put back together behind the oncoming traffic! Today, most passengers are tourists, here for the experience before it is ripped up ready for a new, conventional train to take it\u2019s place. It\u2019s such a shame, because we absolutely loved it. The true Cambodian roller coaster  It went far faster than I thought it would and it was incredibly bumpy, but it was a lot of fun. The line itself is definitely in need of repair, as not all the sections joined up. We got to a point where we would spot the gaps or strange angels ahead and prepare to hang on for dear life!\n\nAs it was only Tom, me and our driver on our train, we were a lighter load than anything we came across, so disassembled every time. For us, it just added to the experience, but I\u2019m sure back in the day you would deliberately make yours the heaviest so you could sit back and enjoy the ride!!!\n\nIn the evening it was circus time! A nearby performing arts school holds a show twice a week and it is something not to be missed. It started out a little bit weird and creepy, as it was titled \u2018Chills\u2019, but it soon turned light hearted with juggling, Diablo, and acrobats galore. These kids were incredible, the littlest of course being thrown around like a bouncy ball!! A great end to a fun-packed couple of days in Battambang Love Jo and Tom x",

        "contents": "We knew this day would come, but it didn\u2019t make it any easier. An awful border crossing!\n\nOff the bus from Siem Riep, we had to walk to the Cambodian office to be stamped out, and then it was a short walk through no-mans land to get to the Thai border control. As we approached, we saw straight away it was going to be a long one. There were people everywhere, standing in groups and queues, all in the blaring sunshine. Once we\u2019d finally figured out where and what we were meant to do, the waiting began. Three hours it took us to get a stamp in our passport, just to say, yes, you may come to Thailand for a mere 15 days!! The most frustrating part was the lack of organisation and the people who simply walked past the queue and straight in. Money definitely talks out here! Surviving that ordeal, the next shock was entering Bangkok! It was crazy, and has changed drastically since I was last here. They have a sky train now!! It was very weird suddenly being surrounded by all this development and recognising brands from home; McDonalds, Starbucks, Macro, Tesco even IKEA! Neither of us felt any great need to stick around here for long, (we\u2019ve seen enough temples to last us a lifetime), but it was a fantastic place to get our first, and much looked forward to, Thai meal!! The stress of the day melted away as we tucked into an incredible pad Thai!! Mmmmm\u2026 Day two and it was time to celebrate our four year anniversary! Aww!! Crazy, I know, that we haven\u2019t killed each other! Spent the day cruising along the river, wandering around markets and, as Tom and I do very well, eating good food! Enough time spent in the city, we needed to sort out our beach withdrawals. A rather uncomfortable 9 hour train journey in third class and a night ferry later and we arrived in Ko Tao.\n\nKo Tao is a beautiful island off of the East coast of Thailand. Most people who come here take advantage of the incredible reef surrounding it, luckily enough, it's also the cheapest place to qualify as a PADI open water diver. I did mine when I was here last, so this time it was Tom's turn. The moment we landed on the island we looked into making this happen. There are so many options to chose from that it took quite a while, eventually he booked with the same company I did mine with, to start in a few days time. First we had full moon to do!! The full moon party has become a bit of a Thailand tradition for backpackers. Once a month everyone flocks to Ko Pha-Ngan, covers them-self in UV paint and dances on the beach until the sun comes up. Having raved on about how much fun it was when I was here before, Tom of course wanted to check it out, and I was more than willing to go again!\n\nTo save ourselves a few pennies, we opted for the surprisingly popular option of boating over to Ko Pha-Nhan from Ko Tao the day of the party and back again the day after. We knew we'd be up late/early, so it seemed pointless to pay for a room, again, might as well save money and just keep dancing until it's time to get the boat back. With hindsight, this was stupid!! The only boats still available got us onto the island at 11.30 am and leaving to go back again at 12 noon. It was a loooong day. Still, we met some great people on the boat over doing the same thing, so at least we could get through it together!\n\nThe day went surprisingly quickly, chatting on the beach and going for the occasional swim. Soon it was time for dinner, then nothing else to do but begin applying the paint!! I can't deny that I loved this part, and had soon decorated every member off our groups face! Everyone was in the party spirit and ready to hit the beach. It was totally crazy down there, thousands of people dancing to every kind of music along every stretch of sand in sight. Of course we jumped straight in and left only at 3 am when hunger got the better of us. Refueled, we rejoined the party for the best bit, sunrise!\n\n(Didn't want to risk losing/breaking the camera so no photos I'm afraid!)\n\nOverall we both had a great time celebrating that the moon had completed yet another cycle. However, it was a long and crazy night that perhaps would have been better appreciated in a smaller dose, with the option to have somewhere to crash if we wanted to! Walking around still covered in paint in the sun at 10 am is not fun! I have never felt so tired. We were both very glad to make it back to Ko Tao and to our room, made it to bed at 4 pm!! A quick dinner a couple of hours later with a friend for her last night, and we parted ways ready to recharge for a diving filled couple of days!\n\nLove Jo and Tom x",

        "title": "An Underwater Adventure on Koh Tao!",
        "contents": "Once we'd finished our party antics on Ko Phangang it was time to rest those sore heads and get ready for an intense few days of submersed fun! It was time for me to learn how to dive! Jo had already passed her PADI on Ko Tao on her previous year of travelling so we had to choose somewhere that I could learn whilst she could fun dive at the same time. As luck would have it, we ended up at the exact same place that she qualified all those years ago, it probably has something to do with the  awesome bungalows included in the package, and the ex-student rates she got for fun dives. Bargain. On  my first day there was a chunk of theory, I did try to concentrate for the 3 hours or so of educational videos but I was pretty tanked up on the free coffee available! It had been a while since a guesthouse with a free kettle! I met my other students then too, one Thai guy lived on Ko Tao and was the manager of a hostel there, he'd come with his boss and two girls at the hostel to learn. It turned out the boss was already a Dive Master (a fairly high qualification in PADI) and he was bringing his underwater camera with him on all our dives! Sweeeet!) After lunch on day one it was time to grab our gear and jump into... the swimming pool! Yey!! I guess it was to prevent any of us drowning on dive one! It did feel a little silly making all the official diving hand signals (yes they're deadly serious, you can't exactly \"chat\" underwater) whilst kneeling in a 1.5m swimming pool! At least we could surface if we needed to ask something, a luxury you don't have 18m down under the sea! Jo joined in on this session as part of her \"refresher\" course, basically a supervised reminder for people who haven't dived in a while to ensure <em>they </em>don't drown on their first jump back in! After lots of practicing taking the regulator in and out, emptying your mask and all sorts of other necessary but tedious tasks, we were ready for day two and our first open water dives! Of course, this all had to happen after another morning of theory! Doh! Dive's one and two took place at Hinwong Bay and Mango Bay respectively, although mainly aimed at getting us used to the water and practicing some tasks we'd done in the pool in open sea, the experience just blew me away. For a start, we descended right into a huge school of fish! There must have been thousands of them, swimming around in a sort of underwater tornado fashion! Our instructor thought it best that we practice our tasks right in the middle of them and I tell you, its pretty hard to concentrate on underwater theory when you have a few thousand fish swimming around you! Dives three and four the following day took place in the morning which is a good time to see marine life as they gear up for the day. We dove at Twins followed by White Rock. These two sites were awesome actually, far from just coral on the sea bed, they're both huge underwater rock formations which are covered in the coral giving a wicked 3D environment to explore! There are big cracks between rocks which harbour some pretty awesome  fish, and plenty of nooks and crannies beneath rocks where we saw  blue spotted sting rays and white moray eels. It was from these two dives we got the best photos! After dive four I'd officially passed my PADI (YEY) so I congratulated my other course mates (who'd also passed) and thanked my instructors and such. Luckily for Jo and I, the fun wasn't over yet! Me, now being an ex-student, also qualified for ex-student rates so we booked some fun dives for the following day! Now I could really relax and enjoy myself without having to practice skills or \"show competence  to my instructor\". These two dives were amazing. The first one, which took place at White Rock, had so many swim through's and such amazing fish. We were really lucky in that we spotted a yellow box fish twice during our dive! We also had the hair raising experience of spotting many <em>many </em>trigger fish. These are fairly big fish that are normally harmless but can be very defensive of there nesting/eating area. They normally chow down on coral so have some pretty hefty teeth too and are well known for having a bite on the odd diver that gets too close. Amusingly the underwater symbol if you see a trigger is... you guessed it, make a gun with your hands! This does lend itself to making you feel like you're in some kind of underwater western, popping off the nasty fish as you float on by! All you need is a cowboy hat to complete the image! It was on my final dive with my instructor that we took group shots on the sea bed (at White Rock). It was pretty hard to organise as once we'd taken off our masks to pull a pose, you could no longer see any hand signals so didn't know if the photo had been taken or not. This resulted in around 4 or 5 photos with a mix of people with their eyes closed, bubbles in front of their face, their mask not fully off or just floating away etc etc! Pretty funny out-takes if you ask me! Anyway, you can see it was a lot of fun! Now onto Railay!\n\nLove Tom &amp; Jo",

        "title": "Malaysiaaaaa is in Assssssssiiiiiiaaaaaaaaaa!!!",
        "contents": "<span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">So here we are, Malaysia! Thailand feels like it\u2019s flown by! As we\u2019d been travelling on the west coast of Thailand, our first stop in Malaysia was another western island. We took the boat over from Satun with relative ease, getting stamped out without any silly fees like all the other border crossings, which made a nice change.</span> Langkawi is the name of an archipelago of islands that are pretty well known with the more wealthy tourist due to their selection of incredibly high rated resorts, some of which own entire private islands. The sands are bleach white, palm trees line the shore and the breeze is warm and fresh. Don\u2019t be fooled however to think this is some serene paradise, as Jet Ski\u2019s whiz up and down, banana boats throw their groups into the surf and parasail enthusiasts are flung around the sky from the back of speed boats getting a bird's eye view of the place! Langkawi has definitely been kissed by development. Being our first stop it was our first taste of Malaysian food, and if its anything to go by, we\u2019re in for a treat! We found a fantastic local restaurant which served most different local dishes at fantastic prices allowing us to try many a different flavour. The cuisine takes on a blend of Thai, Chinese and Indian and as we love all three at home, naturally we love them here! One amusing story from Langkawi was the day it rained, big time! We\u2019ve been used to the odd shower either in the evening or over lunch as we enter monsoon season, but on our third day in Langkawi the heavens opened! We heard the rain from in the room so figured we\u2019d wait it out. Jo went into the bathroom a short while later to discover it had flooded, or rather was flood-ing! The bathroom just drains through a hole in the wall to outside and it appeared the level of ground water outside was higher than the hole\u2026 a problem! We agreed we should inform the owner, so opened the main bedroom door to discover\u2026 the entire corridor flooded! Jo and I looked at each other then simultaneously said \u201cI think they already know!\u201d. The next few hours we\u2019re dedicated to finding the flip flops which had floated away! After four days on the sand we moved on. A rather amusing journey as in true Tom and Jo style we left planning this leg until the day before and discovered the ferry to Penang island, our next stop, was full\u2026 My solution was to devise a much more complicated route which took us on a (non full) ferry to the mainland, a local bus from the dock to a city, an intercity bus from there to another closer city and a local car ferry from there to the island. Thankfully, by some stroke of luck, it all worked out to plan, and as an added bonus cost us half the price of the direct ferry! That meant because we had \u2018saved\u2019 that money, surely we could spend it on some more amazing food in Georgetown? Yeah, that was our logic too! So Georgetown is on an island called Panang, about 3 hours south of Langkawi by (fast) ferry. It was an English colony and when we visited the remains of Fort Cornwallis we learned some bits and bobs. Sometime around the 1860\u2019s a guy called Francis made an agreement with the Sultan of the region at the time for control of the island. The agreement had about 9 statements to it but the gist was that we Brits would pay him a sum of money each year to own the island, he wouldn\u2019t do any business with any of our enemies and we wouldn\u2019t with his, and he couldn\u2019t impose any tax on stuff that we imported to the island. Due to the islands roots, the architecture is really varied but with some outstanding colonial buildings. On one of our days we took a trip to the top of Panang hill, yep it\u2019s a hill in the middle of the island. From the summit the view was amazing, we could see the whole island and even some of mainland Malaysia. It's this island which is connected to the mainland by Asia\u2019s longest bridge. We could see it from the top and it really is an awesome feat of engineering. Apparently there is a marathon each year across is (although I\u2019m not sure of the actual distance ran). The other main appeal of Georgetown is again, the cuisine! Although it does sound like Jo and I are taking some sort of Gourmet tour of South East Asia, this is genuinely one of Georgetowns main attractions. With a busting Little India and China town right in the centre, you really are spoiled for choice with what to eat. Our general day plan was to have Roti for breakfast in Little India, followed by either a Chinese noodle dish or Indian curry for lunch. Then, evening meal was reserved for something specific we\u2019d heard about and wanted to try before heading down to Red Garden in the evening, a sort of late night Karaoke/Food/Drink venue set up like an outdoor market! It takes a certain kinda place to be able to serve decent Sushi to me whilst Jo eats fried duck and rice, and ice cream! After spending our time in Georgetown we needed to go to a cooler climate. The room we stayed in didn\u2019t nearly have an adequate enough fan so we hopped on a bus to the Cameron Highlands! Off to enjoy a decent cup \u2018a\u2019 tea!\n\nLove, Tom &amp; Jo x",

        "contents": "Despite momentarily considering staying on Ko Tao for the rest of our time in Thailand and doing our advanced diving course, a quick look at the prices and then our bank accounts made the decision for us. It was time to move on. A crowded  night ferry, bus and long tail boat ride later and we arrived at Railay beach. This all went quite smoothly but the next hour was not quite so. We'd spoken to some people as we got off the boat about the best and cheapest places to stay. Straight away they recommended the beach furthest away that can either be reached by a long road that goes right around the peninsula or by climbing over 'a few rocks'. We of course opted for the shortest route that involved full on scrambling over rocks on all fours. We didn't make it! After about an hour of rock climbing, stopping to 'discuss' if we were going the right way, going back etc, it was finally the army of giant red ants falling on us from over hanging branches and biting us that made us turn around. No amount of discount on a room could have made that worth while! With that stress over, we found a cheap room on the main beach and swam our troubles away in the crystal blue water. Railay is one of Thailand's best beaches, it is beautiful. Lined with karsts along its shoreline and magnificent rock formations throughout the peninsular, it's not only spectacular to look at, it is also a climber and adrenaline junkie's paradise. Tom now being completely obsessed with diving decided not to climb here, and likewise, I remembered how terrible I was at it when I was there last that I also chose just to spectate. This, along with enjoying good food, is how we spent our few days on Railay beach. The pictures say it all really! Unfortunately, all too quickly our time in Thailand came to an end. Rather than try to do the whole journey from Railay to Malaysia in one day we decided to break it up and spend a night in Satun. I am so glad we did. It was a great little town, full of locals that we finally found a place that felt like the real Thailand. We'd also timed it perfectly as it was the weekly night market. The plan had been to find a place for a good final Thai green curry, our favourite. Instead, one walk through the market introduced us to so many different looking dishes that there was no way we could just walk past without sampling them! We tried a fried spinach thing ( a bit like bubble and squeak), a chicken, salad, peanut, chili sauce dish, little tiny dough crosses with a sweet dip and a strawberry frozen yoghurt desert that I could have eaten again, covered in chocolate drops and fruit. Mmmm! Not the healthiest of dinners, but delicious and a great way to end our time in Thailand.\n\nLove Jo and Tom x",

        "title": "From the Highlands to the Bottom of the Sea",
        "contents": "Our next stop was a well received break from the heat, in the cool highlands. When we first checked into our room our initial reaction was to look for the fan and checked it worked. There was no fan, but rather a blanket, indicating what the weather had in store for our time there! We spent our few days in the Cameron Highlands relaxing in the small town and chatting to people at our guesthouse. We did have one active day, where we got a local bus to the tea plantation, walked around the factory and then sampled their product with cake overlooking the rolling green hills. To soak up even more of the fantastic scenery we decided to walk all the way back into town stopping at a rose garden, bee farm and cactus shop on the way back. We were exhausted by the end of it, as it was probably around a 15 km trip! The highlight of the day was coming across a strawberry farm serving afternoon tea at a price we could afford. For RM14 (\u00a33) we had a pot of tea, four scones, homemade strawberry jam and cream!! Was delicious! Enjoyed it so much that we returned again the next day! Having got used to wearing long trousers and a jumper for the highlands, the Perhentians came as a bit of a shock to us. It is hot there! Although, now having spent almost six months enjoying hot weather, it\u2019s more normal to us than the cold! The Perhentians are two islands on the east coast of Malaysia, and can only, quite simply, be descried as paradise! White sand beaches lined with palm trees with the clearest sea I\u2019ve ever seen. We stayed on the smaller of the two and spent almost two weeks there. We well and truly fell in love. Fresh from the speed boat from the mainland, we struggled to find somewhere affordable to stay. Everywhere gets booked up early at the weekend by domestic tourists. In the end we had to bite the bullet and splash out for a bungalow for a few days, then we moved to the place next door to save RM10 (\u00a32) before finally moving to the other side of the island for an even cheaper and better room. We spent most of our time over on this side anyway as it had far more shade throughout the day, cheaper food, where our dive-shop was and where all our friends hung out. It was stupid that we didn\u2019t more before really! For most of our two weeks, we chilled out on the beach with the people we\u2019d met on the boat over or randomly on the island. We also did lots of snorkelling and swimming off of the beach right by our room. On one of the days during our first week, we decided to explore the south of the island, which supposedly has a path going all the way around. We had a fantastic afternoon walking through the jungle with monitor lizards running around to get to secluded white sand beaches. The snorkelling was incredible off of these and Tom and I saw our first humphead parrotfish, which are pretty massive! The lovely brick path took us all the way around and to the local fisherman\u2019s village, but that\u2019s where it all changed. Out of nowhere the path stopped, leading us to believe we\u2019d have to walk part of the way along the rocks. We tried for a while, where we met Derek and Claire who were also trying to decipher the correct route. To cut a very long story short, we tried going back through the jungle and that didn\u2019t work. Instead we ended up going almost all the way back along the rocks. When there was a gap too big for us to jump, two would swim around, the others would throw the bags to them and then also swim around to join them. It took a long time!! Probably would have been quicker to turn around and go back again, but that is the beauty of hindsight! Eventually we spotted the actual path going through the jungle and were over the moon to be reunited with it!!! Whilst we were here we also treated ourselves with three dives. Here is the first place we\u2019ve come across where they have a ship wreck shallow enough that Tom and I are able to go to. We can go down to 18 metres and the deepest point of the wreck is also 18 metres. Perfect! As a slightly more difficult dive, our dive school first wanted to see how good we are and check we don\u2019t swim around by bouncing off of things (or each other). This meant our first trip back to the bottom of the sea was a site called Temple, simply because the reef looks like an Aztec temple. It was a fantastic site to start with, really easy and loads of incredible things to see; we saw bamboo sharks, moray eels, stingray, porcupine-fish and puffer-fish.\n\nThe big one came on day two when we dived at Sugar wreck, a sugar cargo boat that sunk in 1999. The visibility was appalling, which just added to the eerie-ness of the dive. At times I could only see the yellow fins of the person in front! To add to this, I was having major issues with my mask as it kept filling up with water! Not ideal when I couldn\u2019t see where I was going anyway! It was a fantastic dive though, as we first started descending, it felt like being in the beginning of Titanic film! Our friend Becky, who came with us, said she had the theme tune going around in her head the whole time! The boat itself is on its side, but has an opening so that we were able to swim through a part of it, single file of course. Then, towards the end of the dive, we swam to the back to the propellers. From that angle you could make out almost the entire shape of the boat, an incredible view, making it clear why so many people love to dive ship wrecks so much. In terms of marine life, we saw leopard sharks, eels, angel-fish amongst others, but our favourite was the lionfish. Although poisonous, these funny looking fish are quite pretty and not all that common, so we were pretty pleased with ourselves for seeing one! Our third and final dive was another easy one. We opted for amazing visibility and lots of fish to look at rather than crazy rock formations and swim throughs. It didn\u2019t disappoint. Best things we saw was a huge whip-ray and a tiny yellow box fish, making it yet another fantastic dive. This may have also been because we knew the dive master who took us, plus our friend was in our group, making it the most relax dive we\u2019ve ever done. When we weren\u2019t diving, we were still never too far away from the water. On one day we did a snorkelling trip with some friends. In total we stopped at six different spots and saw all that we were meant to see at each. Sharks at shark point, turtles at turtle bay and stingrays at the\u2026erm\u2026stingray place! It was a fantastic day, and although Tom didn\u2019t see the shark that I saw at the first place, later when he was watching a triggerfish eat a sea urchin a huge black tip reef shark swam past, so he was pretty happy. We both saw the two huge sea turtles at turtle bay. I was thrilled that the moment I\u2019d chosen to dive down deeper to have a closer look, it was heading to the surface for air. It was only about a meter away and at eye level the whole time, that I saw it in incredible detail. Fantastic experience.\n\nExactly one week after our first encounter with Derek and Claire trying to go around the island, we had our second adventure day. Now more commonly known as adventure Sundays. Not satisfied that we\u2019d seen the whole of the island, this time we took on the northern part. A short hike to the wind turbines on the hill, we picked a path and followed it to a deserted beach. The four of us got straight into the water with our snorkelling gear and let the current take us past a further two beaches and some breathtaking coral. We saw loads of fish; humphead parrot fish, rabbit fish, goatfish, stingrays, barracuda and lots of baby sharks. Rocking up at Romantic beach we realised quite how far we\u2019d come and that to go against the current would be far from the smartest thing to do. Instead we headed inland, where, thankfully, bits of ribbon had been tied around trees to mark a route for us. It was not an easy walk, especially without shoes. There was nothing romantic about trekking through a sweaty jungle being eaten by mosquitoes! We were very happy to get back to our starting point!! Overall, Tom and I both had a great time on the Perhentians. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that there are no ATMs on the island, and cash back was becoming expensive, we would probably still be there!! Nevertheless, two weeks was probably a good time to allot to laying on the beach, diving and snorkelling. Time to move on and see somewhere new in Malaysia!\n\nLove Jo and Tom x",

        "contents": "<span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">Fresh from the jungle, the plan was to make it to the relaxing island of Tioman asap. However, after a day on buses and it already pretty late in the day, we took a pit-stop in a town called Kuantan. It's a pretty average town with market, bus station and Chinatown, except the weekend that we were there TV3 were hosting their annual Jom Heboh festival!! Very exciting for us!! (For those of you who haven't noticed, you put our names together and you get Jom!)</span> There were hundreds of people out, shopping in the markets or trying all the samples being handed out by the sponsors. Was pretty random, but a lot of fun. Stumbled across the food tent where there was a cake decorating competition going on, and some great satay to try. We were just annoyed that the kids section was closed!! Left feeling pretty pleased with ourselves for finding it, plus a bag full of discounted crisps. Successful day! Moving on from Kuantan we completely missed timed the buses so had to spend the day hanging round the bus station moving from caf\u00e9 to caf\u00e9. This also meant that by the time we reached Mersing, the town before Tioman island, we had missed the last ferry and had to spend the night. Thankfully we have plenty of time and a relaxed plan, and it turned out to be a great little town. The guesthouse was also really good with a fantastic Malaysian owner. Turned out he used to live in Wimbledon! Bright and early the next day we joined the long queue for the ferry and embarked upon the 2 hour journey to Tioman island. Being so close to Singapore, it is a favourite holiday destination. Luckily for us most people got off the boat at the stop before ours where all the fancy resorts were. Only those of us with a backpack rather than suitcase continued on to ABC beach where all the budget accommodation is! It is a really nice island. We found a great little bungalow with a veranda and sea view (well, if you stood on the steps of the veranda you could see a bit of sea!) The beach was mostly rocks and the snorkelling wasn\u2019t amazing, but we met a good group of people and still managed to have a great few days there. The island was full of wildlife. Monitor lizards and monkeys hung out around our room, a frog somehow moved into my bag and there were so many kittens that we had to allow an extra 20 minutes to get anywhere as we\u2019d fuss over them on the way. Contemplated putting one of those in my bag instead! On one of the days we went in search of a better beach, which required an hour walk through the jungle. It was nice to find a clear beach and have a good swim without damaging the already pretty damaged reef. The only problem was that this beach was called Monkey beach and it lived up to it\u2019s name. Tom, a friend of ours and I were in the sea when I suddenly spotted a monkey lift my flip flops off my bag and start going through it. As I yelled \u201cMonkey! Monkey!\u201d we all swam as fast as we could back to the beach trying to make as much noise as possible. Stupid monkey was not phased by this at all, and only ran away when we were about a metre from him. It didn't put him off either. He continued to circle us and then when the boys went off to check out the reef leaving me on bag guard, the monkey tried it again. So much for a relaxing day laying on the beach. Instead I had to keep looking around and getting up waving a stick when he got too close! A fantastic island, but again, over too soon. Time for some city living in Singapore. Love Jo and Tom x",

        "contents": "Well it was tough to say good bye to the Perhentians, and we knew that wherever we ended up next would have a lot to compete with, but all that being said, Cherating did an awfully good job of a rebound. The town itself is very small, built around a smallish beach, which gets its notoriety from surfing. Again, in true Tom and Jo style, we visited in the complete wrong season for any surfing, causing the place to be somewhat of a ghost town! This definitely had its advantages however, as the accommodation was cheap and nice, we stayed in a semi-detached chalet a few minutes walk from the beach. It was so nice and relaxed here in fact, that we ended up staying a week, although what we actually spent a week doing I have no idea as time seemed to slow down. We did venture to the beach a few times, one day we even walked to a turtle sanctuary a few km\u2019s down the road, which was most rewarding as they\u2019d just had a nest hatch three days ago, so had a few hundred three day old turtles swimming around! <span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">As our guesthouse had a communal kitchen, we caught a bus to the nearest supermarket one day, with the hopes of buying luxurious foods like pesto pasta and cheese!! Unfortunately, we should have known they would only sell local foods such as noodles and rice. No prizes for guessing what we bought there! The novelty of cooking our own food soon wore off!</span> It turns out we aren\u2019t the only people to get stuck in such a place, our neighbour, a Scottish writer, had moved out here to write his debut as the costs are so cheap, and had been living in the chalet for 18 months, visiting the border every three for a new visa! When we were surprised by this he simply told us that was small fry compared to the lady in another chalet who had apparently lived in Cherating for 27 years! Also, visiting the border every three months!! One activity which we put our hands to during our time at Cherating was Batik. The act of drawing in wax and then dying the fabric turns out to be great fun, and Jo was in her element as with all things arts and crafty! She opted for a brilliant and vibrant peacock design, with blending colours and really utilising the batik for all its worth\u2026 I drew Mario! Both masterpieces, I\u2019m assured! On our final evening in Cherating we took a river cruise as the area is home to one of Malysia\u2019s species of firefly! Not knowing what to expect I was totally unprepared for how\u2026 magical the experience was! As the boat glided on down the river in near total darkness, small specks of light emerge from the trees and fly over to inspect, spiraling around the boat and your hands and head! A totally out of this world experience In the need of some adventure and in an effort to kick the sleepy Cherating lifestyle habit, we boarded a bus to Taman Negara, a national park in the heart of Malaysia, apparently one of the worlds oldest untouched jungles! To reach the park headquarters we had to take a three hour boat ride down a mangrove lined river, upon which we saw some fantastic avian life, although no crocodiles! Rather amusingly at the jetty to board the boat we met a Singaporean tour group, also visiting the jungle, however they seemed to be a bit more keen than us. They had all got matching lime green T-Shirts, had a seating plan for there the boat based on the size and ability of the SLR camera they had, and were taking so much luggage we thought their boat may sink! Several times on the river we passed them, or were overtaken only to succumb to a paparazzi style barrage of photographs like a scene from Hollywood! One aspect that Taman Negara is quite well known for is its abundance of leeches! The little blood suckers are everywhere, and are drawn out even more after a heavy shower. Only owning open walking sandals at this point had me somewhat worried we would be sucked dry, so Jo and I resorted to something I hope never to repeat in the UK, Socks and Sandals! Again by some stroke of fate, the day before we attempted our days trek the weather was fantastic, glorious sunshine beaming down, keeping all the leeches at bay! We did, however, get bed bugs, which kept us up the night before our walk as every phantom itch required the torch to be shone and the room re-checked!! We spoke to another traveler who had trekked the day before us, a day preceded by heavy rainfall, and she had been literally, eaten alive by the little critters! That being said, our trek was great fun, climbing over fallen trees and ducking under hanging vines! Well worth the effort! Love Tom and Jo xx",

        "title": "Welcome to Singapore!",
        "contents": "After our visit to Tioman island, we hopped on a bus to Singapore! We were fairly excited as it had been such a long time since we\u2019d been in a city, and the hustle and bustle was certainly very different to what we\u2019d been used to for the past few weeks! We found ourselves a great little hostel in the Little India district, a short walk from the centre but with all the amazing food stalls we wanted to try! They even gave a free beer to those who didn\u2019t book and just showed up, perfect! Seeing as we\u2019d arrived late we didn\u2019t explore the city that night, rather planned an action packed day tomorrow! Our first day, we started by walking to the main river whereupon several, very flash, restaurant and shopping complexes have been built. The several \u201cQuays\u201d we\u2019re very nice to walk around, but have a very western feel to them and at several times Jo remarked at \u201chow like London it all is!!\u201d. Whilst crossing the river on one of the many bridges, we discovered it was Red Nose day for Singapore as a load of students had set up stalls to raise money. Jo and I participated in an arm bicycle challenge where we needed over 160 revolutions in two minutes. Somehow we both scored exactly the same at 210 winning us a Red Nose cookie. Pretty embarrassed Jo got the same as I, clearly I need more stamina, but the cookie was well worth it!! That afternoon we explored Chinatown, followed by the Museum of Asian civilizations. Both of which were very interesting, although the museum was mainly interesting for the huge air con that kept us nice and cool. China town felt like the other China town's we'd visited in other Malaysian cities, although heavily tourist-ified, it did get us very excited for the last part of our trip! That evening was fantastic. At Singapore's main theatre called the Esplanade, a free open air Blues concert was on from 7pm until 10.30pm. The beauty of it all however was the backdrop. The open air stage was in front of the night time skyline of the main skyscrapers in Singapore and right on cue during the second act, they began their light and laser show. I have to say, listening to Voodoo Chile, live by a fantastic Blues cover band, with Singapore flaring lasers around the night sky had a certain Umppphhhh of a \u201cWelcome to Singapore\u201d. The following day we took a trip to the botanical gardens and Orchard road, Singapore\u2019s equivalent to Oxford Street. Again, the sleekness of both places was apparent. The botanical gardens were very well laid out and had plenty of information signs and the like. A definite contrast to other tourist sites we\u2019ve visited around South East Asia! We got totally lost amongst the malls on Orchard road. The first we entered from the metro and it took 4 floors of shops before I realised we were underground and there were another 7 above us!!! Madness. The following day it was time to move on. We\u2019d only stayed a short while in Singapore but even so, we felt like it had fixed our western craving so we could venture out and explore again. We boarded a bus to Melaka, and slept!

When we arrived, our first impressions as with other travelers entering the region, is the huge out of town bus station, plastered with adverts for Jacker's potato crisps (Pringles rip off\u2019s) containing Wayne Rooney, looking mightily unhappy I might add.</span> We found a fantastic guesthouse called Ringo\u2019s just outside of China town. It had been recommended by a French couple with a baby we had met in Cherating, and they were spot on, an awesome spot. One thing plenty of people had said about Melaka was that the food was good. In all honesty, we didn\u2019t find too much great local food, however we did cave in and eat some fast food which was SOOOOO good! They also had a cinema which we visited (when it costs so little to see a film, you can\u2019t resist!). Melaka does have some great architecture and quite a history as well but it was our last stop in Malaysia (this time) and we had to catch the ferry over to Indonesia, we didn\u2019t get too much of a chance to look around. It is clear that a lot of development is going on to turn it into a domestic holiday location, and when the weather is as good as it is here, why not! The only other thing we really did here was buy new walking shoes. Crazy I know. We we're preparing for some trekking we wanted to do in Indonesia, our next location! The ferry crossing to Dumai in Sumatra was mental. Apparently only meant to last 2 hours, ours lasted 5 hours due to the ferocity of the seas, and the locals aboard were all being sick, praying and screaming, so we started looking for the life jackets!! Luckily, the staff seemed to think this normal and weren't fazed in the slightest. I guess we should have turned to them first!\n\nLove Tom &amp; Jo xx",

        "contents": "Fresh from the ferry, (well as fresh as you can be after five hours of being thrown around) we were introduced to our first Sumatran city. Dumai is by no means my favourite city on this trip. It certainly felt like a shock after the slick, clean, flash towns of Malaysia. This place was not so. However, our view may have also been tainted by the fact that it was raining ash. Many of you may have seen the giant smog that hit Singapore not too long ago making it unhealthy to leave the house, well, we were at the cause of it. Something we quickly learnt about Indonesians is they love to burn things!! <span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">Luckily we didn't hang around here long, but quickly boarded our sixteen hour night bus. Although a break from the smoke, it was a rather bumpy introduction to the horror that are Indonesian roads. Surprised we made it in one piece, the final leg was a far calmer thirty minute boat ride across Lake Toba.</span>\n\nLake Toba is a beautiful area that was formed with the eruption of a supervolcano, forming an island in the middle of it.  It was the largest known eruption on Earth in the last 25 million years. Pretty impressive stuff and so it was the perfect place to being our Sumatra adventure. On one of our days here we climbed the mountain in the centre of the island. Or at least, tried to. We\u2019d been told to follow the yellow dots that mark the trail, but after only two or three of them, we could see no more. We spent an hour trying different routes but always reaching a dead end. Eventually a brother and sister from the UK came along and they too couldn\u2019t find it. Time to give up and go back to the road for a drink. We weren\u2019t put off though, I remembered something a woman who has lived here for twenty years told us. Trying again, thankful here advice rang true and we began a very slow climb up the mountain. The views were spectacular all the way up, but it was no easy climb. Since the road was built to get to the top, we're guessing no one other than the occasional tourist takes this route any more. As a result, it was very overgrown and felt far more like a jungle hike than the gentle hill walk that Tom and I thought we were signing up for. I was covered in scratches by the time we made it back to the bottom having not quite made it to the top. We went for the view, so when we were three hours in and had got that, there seemed no  point in continuing!! Good job too, as it was getting dark as we returned to the road. The other exciting thing we did in lake Toba was a cooking course! We do love our food, and after only a couple of days in Indonesia we fell in love with all the new dishes on offer. It felt like too good an opportunity to miss when we saw the class advertised, so jumped at the chance. I made gado-gado (vegetables with a peanut sauce) and a ginger, tomato chicken dish, whilst Tom made an aubergine curry and redang (grated, fried coconut chicken). All four were delicious, plus our teacher has sent us the recipe book for her entire menu! That means lots more experimenting when we get home. All we need now is some willing tasting volunteers?!?!?

        "contents": "So after leaving the wonders of Lake Toba, we took a rather long and bumpy bus to Berastagi. A slightly industrial town, the main attractions here are the two volcanoes, which dominate the skyline. Gunung Sibayak is the closest and tops out at around 2,212m. The second, Gunung Sinabung is about an hours drive away and sneaks a win with 2,460m. Both are active and on the farther volcano you can witness sulphur miners working amongst the geysers! We chose to climb the nearest volcano mainly for convenience, and it\u2019s a more worn route and thus slightly safer. In fact, when we started our \u2018trek\u2019 it became apparent that an attempt to pave the route had been made at some point in the past, and thus we had dodgy stairs and worn away concrete for a portion of the journey! The crater itself was amazing. An overwhelming smell of Brimstone (Sulphur if your old English vocabulary isn\u2019t up to scratch!) and a lot of steam\u2026 When we climbed the volcano there were about 6 or 7 geysers pumping the acrid steam into the air. We didn\u2019t get too close but even just placing your palm on the ground let you feel the heat of the place! Scary! Another exciting happenings which occurred, quite randomly, was that we were invited to a traditional wedding! Some young Indonesian girls who participate in English classes at the hostel we were staying at, whilst we were helping them practice their English, invited us to one of their cousins weddings! About 6 of us decided to go along, and well I have to say, the volume of people present was insane! We were taken to a large open air hall with a roof but no walls, rugs had been placed all over the floor and I would guess at 2000 people were milling around, sat cross legged chatting away! In the centre there was an aisle, whereupon the Bride and Groom stood at one end, listening to the BILLIONS of speeches that were made through out the time we were there. It turned out, anyone who wants to, can make a speech\u2026 and pretty much no body listens to it, as everyone else is too busy chain smoking and chatting to each other!! Carnage! Food was even better, we took out place on the floor and out from the kitchen came loads of servers, some with massive baskets of, yes, rice! Others had curries, some had vegetables and sorts. All the wet food was carried in buckets and ladled out onto your plate in some very slick and yet slap dash fashion. They seemed to know what they were doing! We didn\u2019t stay too long in Berastagi as aside from the volcano and spontaneous wedding, the town doesn\u2019t have to many attractions, so we boarded a bus to Bukkit Lawang, where Jo was planning on stealing an Orangutan!!\n\nLove Tom &amp; Jo x",

        "contents": "So once I peeled Jo away from the Orangutans and returned to the wild, the several baby ones stashed in her rucksack, we popped on a night bus to Banda Aceh, the port town for Pulau Weh. A lovely island, on the north coast of Sumatra, Pulau Weh is a snorkeling and diving paradise! The ferry ride across was much more pleasant than earlier rides and before long we were settled into our idyllic sea front hut, on stilts over the shore. We got straight into the water and explored, and after we could relax in our hammock, with the fish swimming around beneath us! The girls we had met in Bukit Lawang arrived a day after us and we all hung out for the duration of our stay. A common way to server dinner here was as a family meal sorta thing. We would arrange earlier in the day at the family run restaurant we wanted to eat at, then turn up at 8pm for a large meal all together. A very nice and social evening thing, not to mention, great taste! We took a huge snorkel trip one day, right along one side of the island which was so rewarding! In around four hours of swimming we spotted scorpion fish, pipe fish, small baby box fish and baby porcupine. Towards the end of the swim we even saw a turtle, not as close as on the Perhentian's but the water was a lot deeper and it was just gliding through the water beneath us. A nice sight. Oh, and we saw a black and white sea snake! Ironically, the first wild snake I've seen on the trip I think. Most of the others have been in boxes either for looking at or eating!! We also managed to squeeze a dive in whilst we were there. It was definitely a different dive to what we were used to, in that, there was loads of current. I mean, previous dives have been in essentially still or barely moving water. This dive, it felt like we were flying over the coral bed, banking in and out around rocks, whizzing past fish (some fish were even whizzing with us!). We did see some great sights but for me at least, most of the fun was in the technical aspects of the dive. Trying to control your buoyancy whilst being pushed around all over, and check out the fish, and not bump into people or coral, and breathe slowly to conserve air... it was quite a handful! Leaving was difficult but necessary. We needed to go to Kuala Lumpur to sort out our visas so we said good bye to the island, the crystal waters and the colourful fish, and hello to the night buses!\n\nLove Tom &amp; Jo xx",

        "contents": "So, for those of you who haven't heard me talking about them non-stop...we saw orangutans!! We had a short stop over in Medan for a night, then continued on our journey to the gate way to Gunung Leuser national park, Bukit Lawang. Although foreign tourists flock here for a glimpse of our furry relatives, it is also a big hit with domestic tourists wanting to cruise down the river on a giant inflatable ring. On the day we arrived the town was heaving with said tourists, making it rather tricky to find a room. Thankfully, as luck would have it, a guesthouse  recommended to us had a room at a discounted price, only catch was, that it leaked. At the time this wasn't a problem and we jumped at the price. However, two days later during the biggest storm I have ever experienced whilst we were shifting all our bags off the floor and our bed out from under the hole in the roof, I began to wish we'd paid the extra \u00a34 for a functional roof! <span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">Never mind. It took nothing away from what was a fantastic time in the jungle and one of my highlights of the trip. On our first afternoon, we had our first view of an orangutan climbing up some trees on the other side of the river. We couldn't see it that clearly as it was quite far away, but it got us even more hopeful and excited about what we would possibly see.</span> On our second day we entered the national park for the first time ready for their afternoon feed.  Of the 5,000 or so orangutans who live in the 7,927 km national park most are free and able to survive in the wild. However, there are those, usually who have been rehabilitated at the nearby centre or with young to fed, who rely on the twice a day feeding platforms.\n\nWe weren't the only ones keen to witness one of these feeds, and joined the long queue of people traipsing through the jungle to get to the designated spot. For a while we all waited, breath held, hoping to see some movement amongst the trees. Then the calls of the local guy smacking a rock against the platform were answered. At first we just saw the leaves  rustling, then a blur of orange. They really don't blend into the jungle well! Before long we were introduced to Sandra who came swinging through the trees towards us. Apparently she is a regular and knew exactly where to go for the bunch of bananas she was after.  She was incredible! As corny as it sounds, I really don't have the words to describe seeing her. This was something I've always wanted to do and seeing her, as semi-wild as she is, was an unforgettable moment. To top it off, two more female orangutans also showed up each with their babies. At first Sandra wasn't having any of it and didn't want to share, but her shouting didn't pay off as they just swung out over our heads and around her. The babies must have to grip on pretty tightly as their mothers were doing some pretty acrobatic leaps!  My finger nearly broke at this point as I took a million photos!!\n\nIn total we spent an incredible hour watching them come for a feed and swing around. The babies are clearly not quite as good at this yet as their mothers, but it was funny to watch them playing, although there were times when I was convinced they were going to fall!! Just as we were leaving one of the mothers and her baby began to swing towards us, reaching out and onto the tree I was leaning on. They were so close and so cute, I really did want to reach out and steal her. Unfortunately Tom, and all the park rangers, were watching... so still no pet orangutan for me :( Buzzing with excitement, we were ready and raring to go the next day, when we took a trek into the jungle to see Sandra and her friends in the wild. Our guide, Alek, was fantastic and within minutes found us a group of orangutans. We were also lucky enough to see a male orangutan, gibbons and Thomas leaf monkeys. Alek knew, and could impersonate, all the calls, to the point where he would hear one and we'd have to run through the jungle to catch a glimpse of the relevant monkey. It was a brilliant day. <span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">The Thomas leaf monkeys weren't as fast as the gibbons, but far more curious. This may also have been because the guide-in-training who came with us had bananas in his bag!</span> We were also shown a crazy new insect I've never seen before. They may look like white flowers, but they're actually caterpillars that will eventually turn into white butterflies! If you don't believe me, we have video evidence showing them moving about when you wave your hand near them. The male orangutans are quite distinctive with their ginger beards. We got quite a shock when we turned around a corner and found him staring at us. He is massive, and it's got to be taking a lot of strength to hold himself up like that. Didn't look like the most comfortable position to be hanging out in, but clearly good enough to go to the loo!! He looked quite offended when we all started to laugh. The last two orangutans that we saw were probably my favourite. I could have watched any one of them for hours, but the last baby we saw I could have watched for days. He was having a great time! He really did make being a monkey look like a lot of fun. He was swinging out to have a look at us, then would dash up into his nest (they build two everyday!) He'd disappear for a while, then you'd see some orange fur poking out and he'd swing upside down out of the nest, his feet hanging on to stop him falling to the ground. At one point we were all convinced he was chuckling to himself and had a big grin on his face!! It was the perfect end to a perfect day! Love Jo and Tom x",

        "contents": "<span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">So here we are! Back in Indonesia, only this time, much further East. We caught our flight from Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta with ease\u2026 it was actually rather nice to be spoiled on the plane for a change! Its rare that aeroplane food tastes good, but we both agreed it was pretty scrumptious!</span> Upon landing in Jakarta we immediately left the city and headed south to a town called Bogor. This was mainly as we didn\u2019t fancy staying amongst the chaos of Jakarta, but also as we fly out of Jakarta when we leave, so we didn\u2019t need to see the sights this time. Bogor was a nice town, fairly small but with a good atmosphere. The centre is dominated by a large botanical garden, which apparently was designed with the help of Kew in London. This was the main attraction of Bogor and we spent the morning of our one day in the town, exploring all of its flora. One particularly good find was a zoological museum hidden away in there, which contained a vast majority of Indonesia\u2019s animal variety, all be it, in a hunted and stuffed form. Their front piece was a skeleton of a blue whale, which washed up several decades ago, hanging from the ceiling. We also took the time in the botanical gardens to indulge in a nice drink from the gardens caf\u00e9. The terrace overlooked some great lawns and it did feel quite British, unfortunately minus any scones! Oh we do so love the scones! After Bogor we caught a bus to Pandangaran. A very long journey, meaning we arrived somewhere around 11pm. Luckily for us, a hotel was still open and we scored one of the best rooms we\u2019ve stayed in so far. It even included breakfast, if amusingly a little small! Pandangaran is a beach town, almost situated on a land bridge out to an island. The island hosts a national park, which was one of the draws in visiting. On our day of exploration, we saw some great animals, including porcupines and a horn bill bird! The park also contained the only white sand beach in the area as the main beach was black volcanic sand. We did have a slightly scary experience in that the other residents of the white sand beach, i.e. the monkeys, assume each and every human carry large amounts of hidden food! This lead them to be, lets say, inquisitive, and required us to carry a stick around with us for most of our visit! The other real draw to Pandangaran for most people is the surfing. The beach is really shallow so offers some great waves (or so I\u2019m told!) Jo and I gave it a go one morning, a local surf instructor we\u2019d met the night before in a bar told us between 8am and 10am was the best time. Even with this expert advice, we weren\u2019t exactly pro\u2019s on the water! I managed to stand a few times and Jo achieved some form of kneeling hunched ball thing before falling off! Another great part of Pandangaran is the sea food. Part surfing beach, part fishing village, the seafood that comes in is fresh and tasty. We had a meal in one said seafood caf\u00e9 and boy was it good. We chose the garlic butter fish and it just melted in the mouth! So tasty! We actually had a really good time in Pandangaran. The place was really relaxed and we found a great restaurant/bar on the beach where we ate a few times and lounged in the sun. It was a shame to move on, but we wanted to give ourselves as much time as possible further on in Indo so we booked ourselves onto a night bus. Next stop, Yogyakarta!\n\nTom &amp; Jo",

        "title": "Dieng, Borobudur and Bromo",
        "contents": "Wow. Quite a lot to relay now! So after Merapi and our double stay in Yogya, we took a trip to the Dieng plateau. En route we stopped over at Java\u2019s largest temple in a town called Borobudur. You might think that since Angkor Wat we are pretty temple\u2019d out, and that would be true in most cases, but Borobudur has a very unique style and is very impressive, sitting atop a hill, dominating the landscape! We arrived at the most sensible time we could, the middle of the day, so the hottest part to walk around an open air temple. Tom and Jo logic, wins again! This meant that naturally, we thought the bass relief\u2019s on the northern and \u201cshady\u201d side we worth a much closer examination and pondering than those on the southern and blisteringly hot side. Funny that. A top the temple, there sits several circles of round bell shaped stupas. They each contain a Buddha, and sit at equal angles around the main central stupa. As the temple under went a large renovation during the 1980\u2019s some of the damaged stupas had been left open so you could see the Buddha\u2019s inside. After Borobudur, we popped on yet another bus to Dieng. The Dieng plateau is a region of Java, set above the rest on a plateau around 2000m above sea level, the climate here was an awful lot cooler. So much so that yet again, we had a duvet on our bed rather than a fan in the room and not paying for a hot shower was a much harder pill to swallow! Our guesthouse was great, the caf\u00e9 downstairs served huge mugs of warm ginger tea, which in the cooler weather was a real great addition! We arrived too late to explore too much on the first day so spent our first evening planning the morrow\u2019s activities! One big thing to do in Dieng, and just about anywhere with a viewpoint, is to get up the crack of dawn and see the sunrise. We didn\u2019t quite get up in time for that, but never the less, we set out to see the plateau in the morning before the afternoon mists rolled in. It was around a 7km walk to the main viewpoint taking us past some pretty spectacular vistas none the less on the way. We steadily climbed around a large hill, walking through a village and around a tarn. Just before we were rewarded with the view we had a punishing 500 steps to climb, which nearly took us both out but it was well worth the effort at the top! A 360 view of four different volcanoes around us, a huge valley below, the sides all stepped with rice and other vegetable fields! We were pushing our luck with the mists and as we stood there they rolled over the edge of the surrounding hills, flowing down the valleys like water so that the towns popped in and out of visibility. Likewise with the volcanoes, we had to wait for an opening when all four were visible at once to get the perfect photo! Our walk back took us via two volcanic lakes. Its pretty weird to see a turquoise lake bubbling away, stinking of sulphur! No idea if there were any fish in, I doubt it somehow! More amusingly was the Dieng fun fair that we passed on the walk! I hope Angry Birds is getting some commission from out in these parts as pretty much every ride had copied the franchise in some way, from a kids train with an Angry Bird on the front, to the ferries wheel, covered in Angry Birds! The kids hook a duck was hilarious and thankfully Jo managed to snag a picture whilst we waited for our \u201cice drink\u201d to be made. I think essentially it was a paddling pool, with two fish tank pumps circulating the water. And rather than hook out the floating sea creatures (such as dragons!) they kids just scooped them out with plastic spoons!! We only had a short stop in Dieng before travelling back to Yogya. Originally we just wanted to transit as we\u2019d spend a few days here already, but the next train to Gunung Bromo, our next destination wasn\u2019t until the morning so we checked back in at our old guesthouse! Getting to Bromo wasn\u2019t so bad. It took an entire day, a 7.30am train for five hours, a bus for two and a half hours, and then a minibus up to Cecit Lawang, the town on the rim of Bromo\u2019s crater, for about another two hours. Lovely. Again, cue the sunrise activity. Even after arriving in the place at around 8pm, we set the alarms for 4am so we could hike to the crater to witness the sunrise. There are two options whilst there, crater at sunrise and viewpoint after or vice versa. All the tours do the viewpoint at sunrise with jeeps so we\u2019d planned to hit the crater first to try to avoid them. Somehow, in the dark of the morning, and our sleepy state, we managed to miss the path down the crater rim, only 10m from our guesthouse, and walk 2km up a neighboring mountain before we realised we were going the wrong way!! As luck would have it, this was the viewpoint mountain although as we had walked we were on a slightly different part to all the tours in jeeps, so had a fantastic spot to ourselves. Not a bad outcome considering the situation!! Once the sun had risen, we hiked back down, grabbed breakfast and shot off again down the crater rim (now we could see the path) and over the \u201csea of sand\u201d to the base of Bromo. There were a billion guys with horses trying to carry us up to the top and amusingly, the higher we walked up ourselves, the cheaper it got!! The views from the lip of Bromo\u2019s crater were fantastic, stretching right back across the sea of sand to the town where were staying. As it was early morning the sun was fairly low in the sky, casting long shadows everywhere making all the valleys and ruts surrounding the volcano even more prominent!\n\nAfter all the excitement of the morning we were pretty shattered so took the rest of the afternoon off from adventuring. We spent some time in caf\u00e9s, some time napping and general relaxing as we\u2019d decided to attempt to visit another island tomorrow! Pulua Madura was on the cards!\n\nTom &amp; Jo xx",

        "contents": "<span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">To get to our next destination, Yogyakarta, we opted for a night bus to save a day and the cost of a nights accommodation. The only problem being it </span>didn't<span style=\"line-height:1.5;\"> quite last the whole night. At 3am we rolled into the streets of this ancient capital to be dropped outside a hotel we\u2019d randomly pointed at from the guidebook. Despite the \u2018No Rooms\u2019 sign, we turned around to find our bus had vanished into the night.</span>\n\nLuckily, as it was the Muslim holiday of Ramadan, lots of people were up having their meal of the day before the fasting for the day began at 4am. One lady was very friendly and took it upon herself to help find us a room. If one place was full or out of our budget, then off she strode to the next one, us sleepily following on behind loaded with backpacks. By some stroke of luck, by 3.30am we were tucked up in bed in a bargain room, with a full 6 hours sleep ahead of us. The best part? It counted as the following day, so it worked out as a free night! Fully rested, we were ready to take on the busy city of Yogyakarta (the y\u2019s are pronounced as j\u2019s, it\u2019s often referred to as \u2018Jogja\u2019). As I mentioned, \u2018Jogja\u2019 used to be the capital of Indonesia a long time a go, so lots of history and the remains of former grandeur. We spent the day exploring the city, including the ancient walls and kraton (sultan\u2019s palace). It was all very nice, but the lack of any signs written in English did make for a lot of guess work on our part. Still, there was a lot to explore, and the many men and women walking round in traditional dress did give a slight sense of what it would\u2019ve been like in its heyday. The following day, poor Tom had to cope with a rather \u2018girlie\u2019 choice of activities. It started with a silver jewellery making class and ended at the ballet! Although I don\u2019t remember hearing him complaining!! The silver jewellery course was a fantastic way to spend the morning. Jogja has a large silver district, and when we saw the class advertised we jumped at it. We both chose to make rings, and unlike the Singaporean couple who made matching rope style ones, ours couldn\u2019t have been more different. You can\u2019t see in the picture, but Tom also managed to engrave his, but as it\u2019s in Indonesian, who knows what he may have written! The ballet in the evening was also another huge success. Despite waiting outside the wrong gate for over an hour and arriving in a bit of a fluster, the view of the Prambanan temple lit up at night put us in the right frame of mind. The ballet of Rama and Sita was performed on a stage in front of it, providing the best backdrop ever. Luckily they provided us with a handout that explained what was going on, otherwise I think we would be giving it a completely different review. Our highlight was when Hanuman sets fire to the forest, so actually set fire to parts of the stage!! It was pretty impressive, although did act as a reminder of the difference in heath and safety rules! From Jogja, we packed up and headed towards the world\u2019s most active volcano, Merapi. Should have been a simple enough journey, except when we got to where the Lonely Planet had said the bus station was, we learnt it moved 7 years ago! Sweating, annoyed and tired with our backpacks, it looked like it was going to be one of those days. But just when we were at a low point, the couple who had told us this information offered us a lift. They live only a few minutes down the road from the town at Merapi's base, which was where we wanted to go, and were just about to set off!! We couldn\u2019t have asked for a better turn of events, especially as they then invited us into their house for coffee and attempted to teach us some Indonesian. They were so lovely, and even gave us their address, so we will be sure to keep in contact with them. The next morning was when we set off to tackle Merapi and see in the sunrise. As it is so active and they\u2019re expecting it to erupt any day now, we couldn't get too close. Still, the tour we did was really worthwhile, explaining everything that had happened in 2010 when the last major eruption took place. Rather than exploding to the north, the eruption in 2010 was so powerful, it blew the entire top off, splitting the crater down the centre and sending the pyroclastic flow 20km to the south. Due to this unusual behaviour, many villages had ignored warnings to evacuate, causing many fatalities. People in the village 6km away from the crater survived, whereas some in villages 12km away didn\u2019t. Hearing stories like this, it made it very clear the power of Merapi, when to us on the day we visited, it looked so calm. We were also made aware of the level of devastation it can cause by seeing a melted down observation tower, as well as a lava river. This was pretty impressive. When the volcano erupts, the lava naturally finds its way into the valley where the river once was and flows in the same manner. The lava then sets as it is, leaving behind essentially a rock river. It was very weird. Having made it back in one piece, we had time for a quick breakfast before hopping on a bus back to Jogja for a couple of nights. For some silly reason we chose that night to go to a shadow puppet performance. It was very good, except unlike the ballet it was far harder to follow what was going on. Combine this with our 4am start and we were soon fighting to stay awake. The whole show was performed by about 20 people, except only one man controlled the puppets and did the voices. Everyone else was part of the gamelan (Indonesian orchestra, mainly with gongs) or choir. The pictures don\u2019t do it justice, but we do have a lot of videos to play people when we get back. Maybe then you\u2019ll understand why \u2018Ouish\u2019 has become part of our daily vocabulary! Next stop Dieng Plateau.\n\nLove Jo and Tom x\n\n*Photos in this blog aren't the best because some of the files were corrupted when our old hard drive broke :(",

        "title": "Too early at Pulau Madura, too busy at Baluran, but Gunung Ijen was just right!",
        "contents": "Despite enjoying the change in climate up in the mountains, we were pretty keen to get back to lower ground to a temperature we are now far more used to. It then took a further two buses to get to our next destination, Pulau Madura. This island is just north of Java and connected by a bridge, and straight away felt far less congested. The reason we\u2019d chosen this place was for the famous bull racing they hold there in August every year. Except when we arrived we learnt it began in late August, two weeks away, and as it was the end of Ramadan (Idul Fitri), it was even less likely to be taking place. Opps! As a result there wasn\u2019t really much in this town for us to do. We did find the stadium where the races take place, so could guess what it would be like, but I think we\u2019re going to have to save that experience for another trip. We also went around the sultan\u2019s palace, that was a little run down, but contained the first bull racing trophy! More exciting was our next stop, Baluran national park. Of all the national parks and nature reserves we have been to, this is the one we saw the most animals in one day. Deer, peacocks, jungle fowl, squirrels, a ferret, water buffalo, monkeys and lots of birds. The walk itself was also really nice, through the forest and almost savanna feeling terrain. Our ultimate goal for the walk was to get to the beach, which although nice, was heaving with domestic tourists celebrating Idul Fitri. Busy was one thing, but it was eventually the staring, constant photographs and people sitting next to us without saying anything that eventually drove us away. Instead we found our own little cove that was completely deserted to enjoy the stunning views. Around the park, and in particular near where we were staying, were viewing platforms, to allow for even more panoramic views. We both really enjoyed our couple of days spent there. Our fourth and probably final volcano of the trip was Ijen, and probably my favourite. It didn\u2019t have the greatest start, as when we arrived at a town at the base, we discovered that the one hotel was full. Ah. Instead a local guy found us a room in a family\u2019s house, that room being their teenage daughter\u2019s with pictures of her boyfriend everywhere! In the morning, well 1am just about counts, we set off. There is only so close you can be driven to the volcano, then it is a steep climb. Exhausting work, freezing cold, but completely worth it for such clear sky with billions of stars. Tom saw his first ever shooting star, as well as his second, third, fourth etc. It was fantastic! At the crater, it was still too dark to see much. We could just about tell there was a very dark drop off to our left so we should probably try to stick to the right. Walking around to a look out point where there were lots of people gathered, we saw the reason we\u2019d arrived so early; blue fire! Where the sulphur from the volcano gets so hot, it catches alight causing a span of blue, silvery fire. It is one of only two place in the world it can be seen. It was on the way down the steps towards the crater that we met a group of Indonesian students who often climb Ijen. They were really keen to tell us all they new about the volcano, practice their English and of course help us along the way with our very broken Indonesian. The phrase hati-hati was the most commonly used; be careful! They also had some great camera equipment that we were keen to share, plus they knew the best spot for sunrise. As 5am rolled around, there was yet another reward for arriving so early. Sunrise was breathtaking. The sun peaked out over a neighbouring mountain and cast light on just the top part of the crater and other mountains. Plus, by this point we could now see the crater lake, the first one we have seen. The views were stunning, but in the end it was the freezing temperature that persuaded us to head back down and into a warm bed. From here, it was then a lot of transiting, Indonesia is far bigger than we\u2019d anticipated! From Java we crossed over into Bali, spent one night in the main city there, then headed to the beach.\n\nLove Jo and Tom x",

        "title": "Dragons, manta rays and desert islands!",
        "contents": "After our brief spell in the centre of Bali transiting, we continued on our way east. Our initial plan was to skip out Bali this time, as when would have reached our furthest point east, we would need to about turn and travel all the way back again. Essentially we figured we would stop on the way back. This rough \u201cplan\u201d took a slight change when we landed in the eastern port town of Padangbai. A lovely little goldilocks town, not too big, not too small, Padangbai did hold some form of charm for us. We found a fantastic little guesthouse with nice clean rooms, included breakfast and the inevitable, Wifi. This, coupled with another British couple we bumped into whilst looking for a room, meant we had a nice recipe to relax for a few days. I guess the plan to head further east could wait a while! During our time in this town we dabbled in some snorkeling on the nearby reef. The coral was quite impressive but due to its location in a cove on an exposed side, the water was pretty choppy so we had to take care in the shallower regions! We found a fantastic little family restaurant off a side street, where we then ate most evenings! The food was amazing and each time we went back our portions seemed to double in size! A nice little touch was that the menu\u2019s were all handmade, and it appeared that they had gotten children to decorate them! Cue, a kids interpretation of a bottle of Bintang! Once we were done with Padangbai, we peeled ourselves away from what was essentially procrastination of the trip, and hopped on a ferry to Lombok, the next major island in the Indonesia island string! It was actually on this ferry we took the rash decision to turn a short, probably 4 hour journey to the Gili islands, into a mammoth 31 hour journey over to the Komodo National Park. Partly because it was high season and the Gili\u2019s were pretty rammed full, and partly because, we wanted to see dragons! So this epic journey, well, where to start! The ferry from Padangbai took around 4 hours starting at 10am (plus delays), we then had to take a minibus to the capital of Lombok which didn\u2019t take too long but we only just caught the 3pm bus east to the island of Sumbawa. A funny story here being we loaded our bags onto this bus in the knowledge we had 20 mins to get some food, only to turn around and watch the bus leave the station! Understandably, we were pretty worried at this point but some ticket guy assured us it was \u201ccoming back\u201d. We got some food and then a guy on a motorike claiming \u201cbus bus\u201d took us individually and essentially \u201ccaught up\u201d with the bus that had left. It wasn\u2019t too far down the road but I definitely feel like we dodged a bullet there! That bus from Lomok took around 15 hours to get to Bima on Sumbawa. We got there at 6am. This transferred us straight onto another smaller bus bound for the ferry port to Flores, 2 hours away. When I say onto, I literally mean \u201conto\u201d! The bus was full, so us and a good 10 other people had to sit on the roof! The main reason being the ferry was due to leave at 8.30ish so this was the last bus available to get us there in time, I gotta say, at 6am on the roof of a bus after a night bus is not the most comfortable experience ever! Amusingly all the other buses coming the other way also had people on the roof and so often we would exchange passing comments or gestures! It made us feel like some sort of cool club! Likewise, it was a pretty scenic route and with a higher viewpoint and no windows, a pretty good sight to see! So right, we got to the ferry port, this next ferry took a short 6 hours plus 2 of delays to get to Labuanbajo on Flores, our final destination! Shattered, we found a room, found some food, and crashed out for a bit! Staying next to the Komodo National Park, naturally, one day we went to see the dragons! Impressions? Yea Ok they are wickedly huge lizards, and the closest thing I\u2019ll get to seeing a dinosaur! But whether its because we visited them in the hottest part of the day, or maybe we only saw the older/weaker ones, they just hung around in the shade outside the parks caf\u00e9, I assume waiting for snacks! As part of our entrance fee to the island, a guided trek was included. This was pretty good as the scenery on the island is phenomenal, and being a clear day we could see for miles on the crests of the hills. No other dragons though\u2026 To ensure our safety on the island, its compulsory to have an armed guard at all times. This essentially means, a guy with a big stick follows you around. Then, when they tell you how these dragons take down huge buffalo with ease, you begin to wonder the effectiveness of said \u201cstick\u201d! One of the major highlights of visiting Komodo and to be honest, the trip so far, was the diving we did here. Words cannot describe what an experience we had. I would say first that, due to the currents in and around Komodo it was the most challenging diving we have done so far, but it is good to push your limits or you don\u2019t improve. The main part however was on our second dive when, at a dive site that doesn\u2019t normally have \u201cbig stuff\u201d, we stumbled across a group of six, huge, manta rays! It was at a point where the current flows over a sand bank so we were able to hide in the shadow of the flow, looking up at these great beasts flying above us. It was spectacular how they can just glide, effortlessly, through the water. We\u2019d been told they were intelligent and curious animals and no two other words fit so well, they literally come up to you to have a look! Our videographer got swamped by one as it playfully looped around and rolled through the water. Most memorable 10 minutes ever! To top it off, we met some great guys diving who likewise introduced us to more friends they\u2019d been spending time with. As a group of 12 the next day we charted a boat and took a private cruise of some desert islands and snorkelling spots! We nicknamed the boat the \u201cparty boat\u201d, one guy prepared wrist bands (a length of string) as the entrance band, a nice touch! We stopped off at a few islands, having a beach BBQ on one, using fish we\u2019d picked up fresh from the local market that morning. Our captain made an incredible marinade too, seriously tasty fish! Our final island was a tiny pin prick in the ocean, maybe only 30 meters diameter, white sand oasis for sunset. We raced hermit crabs and lay on the beach as the red and orange glows finally dropped out of sight below the horizon. Sublime.\n\nIt was tough to leave Labuanbajo, but we needed to get back across west ready for our flight to Taiwan. Yup, that meant repeating our 31 hour epic in reverse. Fun times!\n\nTom &amp; Jo x",

        "title": "The Last Few Stops in Indonesia; Kuta, Ubud, Kuta and Jakarta",
        "contents": "With our reunited friends from Sumatra, we boarded a ferry, bus, night bus and yet another local bus to finally get to Kuta, Lombok. On the south coast of the island, this small town stretching  along the coast is known for its surfing. Enjoying a slower pace of life, we chose not to give this a go (it was rated as a bit too advanced for us) and took this opportunity to chill out for a week. We landed ourselves with a great room that was a perfect escape from the scorching sun when we'd had too much beach time. The most active we got was on our day of the BBQ. We got up early to reach the local market, only to find that this was considered late for the locals and most had now packed up and gone home. Although with a few less options, we still managed to get two large tuna, squid, sweet corn and some chilies and tomato for a dressing. The next big challenge was to get the fire started on the beach on what happened to be  the windiest day whilst we were there. The boys were undeterred and persevered until we had freshly gutted fish on sticks cooking over a blazing fire. The local women selling sarongs on the beach thought this was hilarious, and kept offering suggestions on better ways to have gone about doing it. We were too far in by that point, but with hindsight we should have asked them first and gone with far smaller sticks. Poor fish had to be tied to their sticks with dried leaves we found! All in all, it was a success. We wanted to cook our lunch on the beach and we did. Taste wise, there was still room for improvement; squid and corn needed longer and the tuna needed more dressing!! We live and learn. After a week sat around playing cards and watching the world go by, it was time to move on back to Bali. Martin and Harriet had a flight from Denpasar to catch, whilst we still had a few days before ours so, were heading towards Ubud. Time to say goodbye and head off in different directions.\n\nUbud was a far different town from Kuta. Being on the island of Bali it's already going to be busy, plus its title as the cultural capital, makes it heaving. Nevertheless we somehow managed to find ourselves a gem of a room away from the crowds, although we did have one unexpected guest in our room when we first moved in. We told the guesthouse owner about it, who then chased it around our room for ten minutes  and then threw it into the river! Wished we hadn't said anything now, and kept it as a pet! The main things to do in Ubud are temples, galleries and cultural dance performances, so of course we had to join in. It didn't take us long to see enough temples and art for one day, as we soon found they are all quite similar. Historically Balinese art is all based on Hindu mythology, telling the same stories but more so depicting the characters in the exact same way. Thankfully, the more modern stuff has some individuality about it, and some of it really as beautiful. The traditional dance show we attended in the evening was also really good. We have experienced gamelan before, but never with dance. The costumes, make up and synchronicity were very impressive, but it was the wide eyed stare and shaking of fingers that blew us away. Having tried to mimic it the whole way home, we  can vouch for how difficult it is.  It was a fantastic show, but as we were sat right by the gamelan, (which if you remember is made up of mainly gongs), an hour was enough!! The pictures don't do it justice, but it will give you an idea. Besides doing all the typical cultural things that this old town has to offer, we also made the most of the boom in tourism. There are nice cafes, shops and bars everywhere, so of course we had to treat ourselves to affordable pizza and I had a massage! It's a hard life! From Ubud, we had one night in the tourist capital of Kuta. (Kuta, Bali not Kuta, Lombok!) If we thought Ubud was busy, it was nothing compared to Kuta. This is where Westerns (mainly Australians)  flock for a cheap beach holiday, to shop at crazy cheap prices and eat and drink the same food as home! Having been warned about this place long before we even stepped foot in Indonesia, we had planned to miss it out altogether, but as the airport is at the end of the beach and we had a flight the next day, it seemed silly to miss it out completely. In the end, it turned out to be far better than people had said. We enjoyed the beach, the sunset was incredible and with a plate of pork ribs, chicken and mash potato for \u00a35, what's not to like! When we first arrived in Java, our plan was to head as east as we could, then turn around and get the train all the way back across Java ready for our flight to Taiwan. This would have meant a 19 hour  train journey. Instead, one quick look online and we found a flight that would take us a mere 2 hours and cost less. Sold! Another massive plus of the flight was that all the incredible things we saw during our time in Java we now got to see from the air! I've never looked out of the window so much on a flight!! Landing in Jakarta, we had three nights before our next flight to see the sights. Things got off to a pretty slow start though, as our first night was rudely interrupted with a swarm of mosquitoes and bed bugs. Nothing quite like it to make your skin crawl for the next few days! Getting over this, and of course moving rooms, we did managed to see some sights. The flea market was a lot of fun, that I never thought I'd see the day when Tom was more eager to shop than me! There were also a few museums, galleries and lots of nice AC malls to look around. Kept us busy for our last few days in Indonesia. We have both had an incredible time in Indonesia, that it had began to feel a lot like home. This is the first country we have really tried to learn and been a little bit successful with the language, that it has opened up a whole new side of the place. With this in mind, we aim to continue this, but with the main language in Taiwan being Mandarin, I'm not sure how successful this will be. Wish us luck!\n\nLove Jo and Tom xx",

        "contents": "<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"font-family:Palatino Linotype, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Our flight from Jakarta flew to Shanghai via Taipei and when we discovered this we quickly changed our flights so that we could have a two week stopover in Taiwan. After spending a week here so far, we're very glad we made that call, this place is AWESOME!</span></span></span></p> <p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"font-family:Palatino Linotype, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">On our first day here we spent a lot of time aimlessly wandering and getting lost amongst the commercial haze that is downtown Taipei. When coming from somewhere like Indonesia, the contrast is unbelievable. Everything, and I mean everything, is a brand. Right down to a small cup of tea on the side of the road, it's no surprise if the whole stall is plastered in \"Hello Kitty\" or some other <i>cute </i>brand with the tea itself named after some other cartoon character. One particular tea shop we found ourselves in was London themed, using a fake tube map covering the mugs with station names such as \"Earl Grey's Court\"!</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"></p> <p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"font-family:Palatino Linotype, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">There are a fair few temples here in Taipei and we've explored a few, and of these few there were two that stood out. The first namely the Confucism temple in Datong district. A rather more interactive museum than temple, with displays allowing you to digitally place your face onto a troop of traditional dancing monks, you can see why I enjoyed myself! The architecture of the place was visually impressive also, using symmetry and projecting lines to there full potential. A great find.</span></span></span></p> <p align=\"JUSTIFY\"></p> <p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"font-family:Palatino Linotype, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">The second temple I feel was Jo's favourite as it was much more of a spiritual and cultural experience, in that it was very busy when we visited. Incense smoke clogging the air, hundreds of men and women chanting and singing, reading from small red books. All the customs are so alien to us, from throwing two red blocks on the ground trying to get one face up and one face down showing \"balance\", to buying cakes and food to give as offerings to there ancestors and Buddha. I felt like at one point an old woman was casting a spell on me as she sat next to me, then started drawing characters on the ground with her staff like walking stick, stamping marks around and giving me ominous looks! She didn't look too happy I was reading the Taiwan lonely planet, she must have been mislead by them too!</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"></p> <p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"font-family:Palatino Linotype, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Some other great places we've visited include the National Palace Museum which was possible THE busiest place I have ever been! We all were issued a one way walkie talkie group guide device just so it was possible to hear our guide due to the volume of people. We would queue up before a gallery/exhibition room and get our brief then so that as we walked around we could see everything quickly to reduce the time for everyone. Madness. As we entered the galleries a ticker would tell us how many people inside, when we started there was 2400 and it becomes a \"one in one out\" system at 2800!</span></span></span></p> <p align=\"JUSTIFY\"></p> <p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"font-family:Palatino Linotype, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Quite by chance it also turned out that a friend from back home had started a two year scholarship right here in Taipei! We therefore arranged to meet up one day and checked out his university. There was a fantastic viewing platform which we had a few beers on, the main attraction being the cityscape that it looked over. As the university is on a hill you can see really far, and it even looks over Taipei 101, the tallest skyscraper in Taipei. The views got even better as the night set in and the city lit up. </span></span></span></p> <p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"font-family:Palatino Linotype, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">On a few of the other days we visited loads if different museums. Amongst them visiting both a glass making museum and a paper making museum! In both we we're able to have a go, creating some cool glass beads in the first and, you guessed it, a sheet of paper in the second! Another we visited was the space museum and although it was all in Chinese, I had a great time explained bit and pieces to Jo, and of course, playing on the interactive displays!</span></span></span></p> <p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"font-family:Palatino Linotype, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">The main thing I haven't really mentioned yet is that Taipei is sort of known for its huge night markets. These things are great fun, you can pretty much buy anything you want but the main sort of market is for street food and clothes. All of the hundreds of vendors are trying to compete for your custom which leads to some pretty innovative ideas. For example, one coffee stall we saw had a sort of stage behind it, and when you ordered your drink, the guy put all the ingredients into one jug, and then proceeded to spin around flailing his arms everywhere, swapping the liquid between the jugs in his hands. Quite literally throwing the liquid around and catching it again, I mean, I'm sure there is an easier way to mix up your coffee, but it sure did look awesome and it clearly worked as his queue was by far the largest!</span></span></span></p> <p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family:Palatino Linotype, serif;\">That pretty much ended our first week in Taiwan. A nice introduction to the Mandarin language but with handy English signs everywhere! As you'll find out, our next week was quite the contrast!</span></p> <p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family:Palatino Linotype, serif;\">Tom &amp; Jo x</span></p>",

        "contents": "As our one and only visit out of Taipai, we decided to visit Taroko National Park. Known for the spectacular marble gorge that runs through it, this national park on the west coast was the perfect get away from the craziness of Taipei city. Despite there being the odd guesthouse in villages at either end, we opted for camping right in the center of the gorge, and took advantage of the beautiful surroundings and, finally, peaceful environment. During our four days in the park, we did a lot of walking, played lots of cards and experienced a lot of rain. It was a easy train journey there and then hop onto a bus to take us to the campsite. In the end we used these buses quite a bit as they run up and down the one road by the gorge. Being 920 km<span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman, serif;\">\u00b2,</span>the bus was the only way we were going to be able to see even a fraction of it. The main attractions along this route are; the Shakadang walk, Swallow's grotto, Eternal Spring Shrine and a cultural centre at Buluowan...but for us, we'd have to add the food into that list too. In preparation for our time in the 'wild' we popped into a Carrefour for all our camping gear, plus food we'd missed from home, such as beef curry, marshmallows and our all time favourite, pesto pasta!! If only they'd had cheese... The main road that runs through the gorge was built between 1956 and 1960 and took a lot of man power. There are memorials everywhere for those who lost their lives in the process, as well as information boards highlighting the impact this road had on connecting the country. As it is such a large national park and terrain not for the faint hearted, it had up until then, been a major obstacle for trade and transport. As well as being made for vehicles, there were some trails designed purely for people to enjoy the view. Shakadang walk is one of the most popular of these, meaning there was a steady flow of tour groups along it. That was until you walked past the toilets and souvenir shop, when we soon found we had the place to ourselves! It was a really lovely trail, often cut right into the walls of the gorge. With the river running through it, there are also lots of pretty waterfalls along the way, meaning I did go a little bit snappy happy. Tom, too, was in his element, thinking he was a pro geologists, looking at all the marble formations and guessing where the rocks had fallen from! The other attractions were the Swallow's grotto and the Eternal Spring Shrine. The first being, you guessed it, full of swallows. With time, many holes have formed into the marble of the <span style=\"color:#000000;\">gorge, which hundreds of swallows now use as ideal nesting spots.</span> This path also cuts through tunnels, before emerging at different spectacular viewing points. The birds swooping around all over the place just adds to this. A little further along the road from here, is the Eternal Spring Shrine that is perched on the side of a hill, built into the rocks. Although we've seen lots of temples by this point, I think this one wins with award for best location. There is also a trail around this area, but unfortunately it was closed during our visit, as were quite a few others. With hindsight this was probably due to the typhoon that was on the way and they didn't want to risk any landslides. Speaking of the typhoon, this blog would not be complete without reference to typhoon Usagi. Although camping the rest of the year probably would have been a fun, dry and uneventful, 2 out of the 4 nights that we chose to be there, were rather wet! We should have realised really, when families arrived early at the campsite, set up, spent the day but were all packed up back in the car by night fall. They clearly knew something we didn't! On the first night of the storm, we'd just finished cooking our dinner so luckily just had to throw everything inside the tent. Once huddled up inside, we then had to spend the next 3 hours listening to thunder and heavy rainfall onto our tent. It was not a fun few hours! The tent only had one layer to it, and that was put to the test! The seams didn't fair too well, and we soon had water dripping in, combine this with water coming through the mesh part and we soon had a situation on our hands. Everything remotely dry and absorbent was used to mop up, was rung out and used all over again. Tom eventually made a hole in the bottom of the tent so that the giant puddle that had formed had somewhere to drain out of. It was a very damp night in our damp sleeping bags huddled up into a ball to avoid touching the soaked through sides. Thankfully we woke up the next day to glorious sunshine and were able to dry everything. The same cannot be said for the morning after the second night of the storm, the morning we had to pack everything up! Things were rather whiffy by the time we made it back to Taipei. Going through all of this did mean that we really did appreciate the warmth and dryness of a bed once in Taipei! It was still very wet there, but there were far more options of places to hide from it than canvas! During our last couple of days here before flying off to Shanghai we met up with Tom's friend from home again and also my cousin's friend. Overall we really like Taiwan, although we only saw two places. If anything these two weeks showed us a place we'd not thought to travel to before, and would now be keen to explore further. But of course, we'll have to save that for another trip, as now it's time for China with Becky!! Love Jo and Tom x",

We started straight away with a bang, getting on the Maglev train to take us from the airport to the centre. Conversation got put on hold whilst we all watch the speedometer get up to 301km/h.</span></p> The next day we headed off to explore the city, starting at the Bund. This stretch of old buildings lines the river and is now facing all the flashy skyscrapers on the other side. The main attractions are th Hong Kong and Shnaghai Bank Building, the Former Palace Hotel and the Bank of China. The Financial Tower, Oriental Pearl, and the new Shanghai tower (still being built) are all on the island opposite. We explored for a while, dying a little in the heat, and laughing at the amount of Chinese tour groups all following their guide with a flag on a stick! The views were perfect of the river, the skyline, and to people watch! The crowds continued at the National Museum, as a new exhibition was on display. I would love to tell you what it was about and how amazing it was, but one look at the length of the queue put us right off. Instead we enjoyed the far quieter calligraphy, pottery and jewellery displays. Not sure we were convinced that the immaculate, white porcelain pots were from 400BC but we'll give them the benefit of the doubt! Other sites in Shanghai we visited included the Financial Tower, that has the highest observation deck in the world. This allowed for some spectacular views of the city, plus we timed it perfectly, witnessing day time, sunset and the city turning on all its many lights. We also went to the old part of town, which has now been renovated into a very flashy souvenir area. I was adamant it was all original buildings just given a face lift, whilst the others disagreed. When we went into one of these 'old buildings' and saw escalators running up and down it, I had to admit I may have been wrong. Don't think they are original features somehow!\n\nThe Yuyuan Gardens around the corner, did however, hold some of their ancient charm. Typically Chinese, there were lots of pagodas, small bridges, ponds and rock gardens. We all really enjoyed exploring this part, especially when we managed to get ourselves a free tea tasting. Unlike the scam that often takes place in Shanghai, we walked out of here with the same amount of money as we walked in, a little bit more educated as to the different teas and how one should make it, but feeling a little less thirsty. A pretty successful tea tasting in our eyes! On one of our evenings in the city, we attended a Chinese Opera. If you asked us our opinion on it, you would get very different answers! Becky and I really enjoyed it, and although we couldn't understand it and at times only dogs could hear it, we valued the skill and the beauty of it. I'd be doing Tom a injustice if I said he hated it, but I wouldn't go so far as to say he enjoyed it. After about an hour, he took the interval as his opportunity to run away. Becky and I also couldn't quite hack the entirety either and slipped out about a hour after that. We still have no idea how long it went on for! We've read it can sometimes last 6-7 ***CHECK**hours! As to the performance itself, words can't really describe it. You'll see in the pictures they wear a lot of make up, the costumes are beautiful, but every moment of the body, fingers and eyes are very precise. They even use their extra long sleeves as part of the story. The singing and speaking is all done at an octave I certainly cannot reach (not that it's stopped me trying ever since) and is drawn out for emphasis. As I said, it's difficult to explain. But do not fear, we have taken plenty of videos, which at the moment act as a way of driving Tom mad when he's least expecting it! As a day trip out, we visited a town called Qibao. Now, this is something we can all agree on, as we loved it. We drank tea over the canal, took a boat trip, watched a shadow puppet performance/watched the old men watching the show eating their pack lunch, and attended a traditional story telling amidst, you guessed it, yet more old men! Everyone was so friendly to us, despite very few being able to speak any English. We managed to get by with lots of pointing, miming and drawing, that we drank great tea, tried some amazing food and met some fantastic people. Whilst in the old tea house that houses the storytelling, we became something of an attraction. We'd heard the last 10 minutes or so, when everyone (everyone being male and losing their hair!) began to pile out, staring at us in the process. A couple gathered around us simple to smile and figure out why we were there. Thankfully one man spoke some English and we managed to converse for a while, all whilst the 90 year old owner of the place rushed around us bringing us tea, and the manuscript of the story. Well, at least that's what we think it is! Although a city with far more to offer than we had time for in a week, it was soon time for us to leave Shanghai. Aboard a train for a few hours, we soon rolled up into our second destination of Hangzhou. As it was getting close to the week long national holiday in China, rooms were booking up fast, so we said goodbye to the dorm and hello to the family suite. Don't mind if we do! Hangzhou is yet another large city, but based around a lake, it has a far more relaxed feel to it. As much as we love noodles, one of the highlights here was the Muslim run restaurant, offering all kinds of different treats. Never thought I could get so excited over hummus and salad! It was so good we ate there twice, one of which was on the night of day 300 of the trip! A momentous occasion that had to be celebrated! On one of our other days, we took a ride on the electric buggies we'd seen looping the lake. Or as it was written on the buggie, and shall hence forth be known as 'looplake'. We had a great time sat on the back, enjoying the spectacular views of the lake and surrounding pagodas, but we also enjoyed the people watching. There weren't that many western tourists in this town so people often double took the sight of us three giggling on the back. Rather than avoid the photos that people had been trying to take of us all day, for that one loop we embraced it, posing and pulling funny faces. Probably meant we got more than normal, but everyone was enjoying themselves, so why not. We particularly stirred up a reaction whenever we went up and over the small bridges with our arms in the air pretending we were on a roller coaster. Not sure everyone understood that this was what we were doing, but they thought it was funny nonetheless! From here, our final destination with Becky was Huangshan. This was the perfect place for us to really chill out, although the walk to our guesthouse from the bus station was anything but. I blame the Lonely Planet maps! Despite this initial test of our endurance and map reading skills,  Hunagshan was really lovely, made up of little lanes of old houses. Plus, we upgraded with rooms yet again, this time to the deluxe triple!! Ooooo!! Didn't realise deluxe meant glass bathroom!\n\nOne of the main things to do, or should I say buy, here in Huangshan was calligraphy sets. There were shops everywhere selling brushes, ink and ink wells. They also had practice sheets outside them so you could have  go with water. Our attempts hadn't been very good, but that didn't stop us. For \u00a31 we bought some brushes and sat outside at a cafe having a go. There were no drastic improvements made in such a short time, but we felt like pros by the end! Also, all three of us went back after to buy better quality sets to take home with us to continue our calligraphy education. Well in our case it was, bought them to send home with Becky! Thank you Becky!\n\nFrom here it was really easy to do day trips. Our first excursion was to two small villages. The first, called Shexian, is surrounded by an ancient wall with a newly reconstructed version of the old palace inside. It was really well done, especially as they made it clear that is was a reconstruction and they weren't trying to convince us this freshly carved pillar was thousands of years old. It was to capture it's former grandeur, and I think it met this aim well. The surrounding area also had lots of genuine old streets and houses for us to fully explore. Just up the road from here is Yuliang, which is even smaller. The streets are narrower, the building older and likewise most of the residence seemed older too!! Again, we enjoyed exploring and found ourselves on the river and took a set on the dam to enjoy the view and laugh at the people pretending to throw their children in! Another day out took us to Qiyun Shan. This mountain is made of reddish sandstone rock and is covered in lots of pagodas and temples. After queuing for over an hour we boarded onto a cable car to save ourselves the hour and a half hike. With hindsight, we should have just walked it! At the top we got incredible views back down and of other surrounding mountains. It really is a beautiful area. We aren't the first to think so either, as many people throughout history have built upon it to take advantage of this. There's even a village and a palace up there. We were lucky enough to see the palace undergoing some reconstruction. Being placed where it is, it seemed a case of using whatever was available and that included the man power. Even the older women were getting involved, carrying sacks of rocks around! And so ends our two weeks spent with Becky. We had a fantastic time cramming it a years worth of information into two weeks, and sharing in lots of new adventures together, and I hope she did too. There's still time left if anyone else fancies visiting us in China... Love Jo and Tom x",

        "title": "A short spell in Xiamen",
        "contents": "<span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">So after Becky left we were back to traveling on our own. Our first task was to get to the south coast and this involved a 15 hour train journey to a city called Fuzhou, followed by a shorter 2 hour train journey to the city of Xiamen. I don't need to bore you with the details but you can imagine 17 hours on a hard 90 degree seat was pretty rough!</span>\n\nXiamen is a great city. The majority of it is situated on an island just off the mainland, and the bulk of the old town and the streets famed for wandering around are all packed near the ferry crossing to Gulang Yu, an even smaller island nearby with a colonial past. Our first day was very uneventful as straight after checking in at 2pm I slept for a good few hours to recover from the night! The second day was only slightly more eventful as the morning was spent in the hostel planning the next few weeks. One thing we have noticed or rather, have had to come to terms with is you can't travel China on a day to day basis, everything must be booked up at least a week in advance otherwise it's full. Hostels, trains, buses, everything. As you can imagine, after 10 months of \u00ecWhere do you fancy going today?\u00ee, trying to change to a \u00ecWhere do you fancy going in two weeks?\u00ee is quite difficult!\n\nOne of our day trips from Xiamen was to some huge round earthen houses called Tolous. These were about 100km to the north so even though they are a \u00ecday trip\u00ee the distances are still ridiculous. Lucky for us we caught a D-class fast train to a town only 30km from them cutting our journey time down a fair bit! After circumnavigating the MASSIVE tourist arrivals hall/centre they've built for the surrounding villages we got on a shuttle bus and finally saw our first glimpses of the Tolous. Fantastic things. They originated when the villagers of particular regions all clubbed together and built one residence for protection from raiding parties. The Tolous only have one door and all windows facing out are second floor or above. The layout is that of a compound in the centre (usually containing a well) surrounded by all the residences of the villagers. Probably best for you just to see the photos! It was really great having an explore and seeing all these locals living in such magnificent surroundings. The rolling hills that these houses are based in are simply spectacular and as many Tolous are higher in the hills rather than the valleys, the vistas are breath taking. Our day trip took an unexpected end when, we essentially lost our shuttle bus and ended up basically stranded in the remote mountain region! Luckily for us, we had tagged onto a Chinese tour group and they offered to take us back, not just to the Tourist service centre, but all the way back to Xiamen! It turned out they were all students from Xiamen University which was about 100m from out hostel! So lucky! One one evening in Xiamen we made friends with a Chinese guy in our hostel called Kero. It turned out he had moved to Xiamen and found work in a nearby restaurant and so stayed in the hostel for two months until he found a place of his own. For this reason, he was good friends with the staff at the hostel, and hung out most days in the common areas. His English wasn't perfect but he knew enough, plus we had Google translate, that we could talk fine and he gave us some really great advice for later in our trip (his home town is Xi'an, where we will be going in a few weeks). We ended up going out for dinner that evening with Kero, he took us to his work and we had a really great meal. It was a popular style out here, where you select all of your veg, meat and noodles and then it gets cooked up for you. He disappeared for 5 minutes and returned with five massive beers which was our first real introduction to the Chinese culture of meal times! In a nut shell, everyone has a small glass which is always kept topped up with drink, mainly because its rude to top up your own first so you must ensure no one else has an empty drink before filling yours. Then, it is borderline rude to drink from your glass unless you are raising a toast to someone, which turns out is a lot! The phrase \u00ecGan Pai\u00ee actually translates to \u00ecDry your glass\u00ee although Kero informed us its more informal than it sounds. Anyway, as you can imagine, with a spicy noodle soup requiring constant refreshments, many shouts of Gan Pai were heard and fun was had by all! Afterwards, Kero took us to a Billards house where we played pool for a few hours, they even give you a special glove which only fits over two fingers to help you play! We had such a good night, ending with some fantastic local fried noodles with squid and vegetables. Another of our days on Xiamen was spent exploring the small island of Gulang Yu I mentioned that it has a colonial past at that meant the architectur of the buildings there was really great. Most of our fun came from just exploring the little side alleys and getting a peek into the past. We did visit one museum, an Organ museum which had a good forty or so, massive old rare antique organs. The main one on show was built by some guy called Beard and it was HUGE. It took up the whole central area. On our final night in Xiamen we'd arranged to go eat with Kero when his flatmate, a girl called Emma invited the three of us to a birthday party of her friend. As her friend teaches English, a lot of her students are ex-pats and thus when we arrived at the bar and it was full of westerners, it meant we could really socialise and talk to people, something quite rare out here in China. We had a great night, a fantastic part being that at quite late in the evening when Jo and I felt a bit hungry, Kero pulled a take away box from his bag filled with corn on the cob and fried squid. He'd somehow picked up over the few days we'd had together that these were our favourite dishes, and he'd snook out to buy some. Fantastic guy. Although he did tell us he couldn't eat any squid because of his mosquito bite on his leg... we've still not quite worked that one out! I've written loads just for Xiamen so I'll split this post up, next is ZhaoQing and GuangZhou.\n\nTom &amp; Jo x",

        "contents": "The final weeks of China After Xiamen we caught another insanely long train to the town of ZhaoQing. Not on the tourist trail but still quite a large city, we were just looking for a place where we could melt into the community a bit and people watch. What a fantastic choice. Finding our hostel proved a tad difficult. It was situated on Jianshu Yi Lu meaning Jianshu One Road. We found road three, followed it to road two, and then dead end. We we're thoroughly confused until after a great game of pictionary with a Chinese taxi driver and his sudden devotion to finding the hostel for us, we found the hostel. We had to take a huge loop around a few road as basically a few apartment blocks and abandoned building sites had been dumped between road two and one. Ridiculous. The hostel was situated right next to a local market and we spent most of our nights eating out with the regulars, noodles and beer on plastic chairs for a few pounds. This is the China we love. I even managed to buy some flip flops from a stall, only two sizes too small, which is a massive improvement from them just laughing at me in Vietnam when I tell them my shoe size. Breakfast. How to describe breakfast. We found a place, mainly because of the surreal speed at which this guy was making \u00ecsomething\u00ee so we took a look. I would describe as steamed savoury pancake mix, with chopped spring onions, an egg and some meat. But the way they make it is awesome. First up the guy spreads the mixture really thinly onto a huge (probably A1 size) tray, covers it in the toppings then slams it into a huge steamer for maybe 20 seconds. Then, he used two spatula like implements to scrape it all up onto a plate. The thing is, he has two trays on the go all the time. So whilst something is steaming, hes prepping another tray, and then he swaps. He goes SO fast. I had to film a video as a cycle from empty tray to plate is around 30/40 seconds, with exactly half the time in the steamer! Really impressive. We took a day trip from ZhaoQing to some watchtowers in the region called Dialou. These were build by Chinese men who went overseas, mainly to the America's, to earn a better living, and on returning to there villages, build huge homes/watchtowers to both show off their wealth and protect it. It was another massive day of travelling for only 2 hours of sight seeing (public transport to blame) but it was really worth it. They're really cool, all jutting out of the rice field. Check out the photos. Our final stop in China before Hong Kong was the city of GuangZhou. Massive, in a word. We found our hostel Okish, in a semi old town area so escaping the masses slightly. And just relaxed for the rest of day one. Day two was good, we took a tour of the opera house there. A very extravagant building as they normally are, the weirdest part for me was that the auditorium wasn't actually symmetrical?! Not sure if it was an acoustic reason or what as the tour was in Chinese. Useful. And that was pretty much it in Guanzhou. I had another experience of trying to have a quiet drink but put to shame by old men, I don't honestly know how they do the whole Gan Pai thing, its ridiculous. One particular man was really funny as he was trying to gesture that after his friend has only one beer he needs to sleep. Or at least that's what we took from the miming! There, the first 30 days of China finished. This trip is really flying by now. Next up, Hong Kong! Tom &amp; Jo x",

        "contents": "In just six days in Hong Kong we have done so much. Although we have done a lot of the touristy stuff, we were lucky enough to meet a great group of people who showed us parts of the city only the well informed know about. &nbsp; One of our favourite things about the city was the harbour. The skyline of Hong Kong can be seen at its best here, and it really is a sight to behold. We have seen a lot of cities by this point, but none quite as compact as here, and the skyline certainly does reflect this. To get even better views, there are the well known and amazingly affordable Star Ferry that shuttles people from one side to the other, and has been doing so for years. There is also the world's longest outside escalator that scales the side of the hill in the centre of town. I was very excited by this, and pretty disappointed when I learnt it was lots of normal size escalators after each other. With hindsight this does make it far more practical, as it would take an awful lot to power something that big! We also saw their old temple, the antique shopping street, the art museum and all the flashy new shops in Times Square. Getting around to all these places was really easy with the convenience of the ferries, MTR (metro system) and the surprisingly a lot of fun, double decker wooden framed trams that are the oldest fleet in the world. On Wednesday evening, we joined the hordes of tourists, expats and locals at Happy Valley race course. This is the evening said to be the least serious and most fun. Tom and I would have to agree with that, especially as they were holding their last Oktoberfest special that night too. It was here that we met Frank and Maureen who were at a Meetup.com event that we'd somehow managed to tag along with. We had a great night with them, learning what was going on and had a couple of bets to give us someone to cheer for. Despite our best guesses, we never came out on top, but actually came last in one of the races! Now with new friends that introduced us to yet more, we spent our time seeing Hong Kong from a new perspective. One evening, we were introduced to Mr Wong's, an all you can eat all you can drink for \u00a35, which was of course a great night. Another evening, Maureen invited us over to her amazing apartment to play games and for a dinner party whilst we enjoyed her spectacular views of Hong Kong. For me, an absolute highlight was of course going to Disney land!! For those of you who haven't heard, this was the last one in the world I hadn't been to, so naturally it was a must see. We both had a fantastic day, really appreciating the quality and safety increase from the theme park we went to in Vietnam. The best area was Toy Story Land, that was really well thought out. Even the benches were made to look like dominoes or lollypop sticks. The rides, shows and parades also didn't disappoint. This was the first time I'd been there for Halloween, so lots of spooky photo opportunities for the domestic tourists, plus a neon parade for everyone else! They even had smoke coming out all along the main street and zombies jumping out at people. I'll admit I did run screaming when I saw one lurking down an alley! After a fun filled week, we ended our time in Hong Kong catching up with another friend of mine from university, who lives in Hong Kong. Mandy took us to a great little coffee shop where they make animals out of the foam in a cappuccino. Complete gimmick both so worth it!! Before we knew it, it was time to cross back into China, our last border crossing!! &nbsp;\n\nLove Jo and Tom xx",

        "contents": "<p>Once we'd seen the delights of the Pandas over in Chengdu we ventured even further North East to the city of Xi'an. Famed for its Terracotta warriors, the vast pits of clay soldiers, horses and chariots, the city itself does also have a few other sites of its own.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, as I had a slight disadvantage in that I couldn't walk around too easily, Jo saw most of these small time sights on her own, bringing the photos back to the hostel for me to take a peak! It looks like I'll be paying the price for the \"Chengdu\" incident for a while. Anyway, the bits of Xi'an that I did get to wander about were great, the city has a big Muslim quarter, which although tourism has blossomed it into something slightly other that what it would be on its own, the food over there was fantastic. On our final day we tried a soup in which you are given a piece of traditional bread in a bowl, you then tear this up yourself into your own preference of chunk sized pieces before getting it filled with whichever soup you ordered. The best part about the meal being that at no point were any noodles or rice involved!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We had a fantastic hostel in Xi'an, we'd booked on-line as with most of the latter month of China, and this paid off in both availability of the rooms, and a good discounted price which we got. We were in a dorm room and as a result met some really great people who we then proceeded to hang out with for most of our time here. On our first evening we checked out a street food stall just down from the hostel offering BBQ meat, bread and stir fried vegetables, super tasty!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The warriors themselves were incredible. We visited them on our second day in Xi'an, giving my foot a bit of time to rest, taking a local bus from the outside the train station rather than the hostels tour. To try and give you the magnitude of how \"big\" a tourist attraction these things are, there were three bus companies offering a direct bus to the Warriors, a journey of around an hour, each company with a frequency of a bus every 4 minutes! And they were all full too, which doesn't include people who drive themselves or take a tour!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At the site there are three main excavation pits, with a museum and exhibition hall nearby. We'd been told to do the pits in reverse order otherwise after the immense blow of the first pit, two and three don't feel like much. This was great advice as it meant that every new pit we entered we were blown away that little bit more, and I understood why people said that as pit one has around 2000 warriors on display whereas pit three only around 20!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>So as to the actual warriors, they had a surprising amount of detail on them. We're talking about things like hair and armour texture. One warrior in pit two which they have in a glass box so you can get close, allows you to see the sole of his shoe and the detail in it is astounding.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/p1150813.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1252\" alt=\"Jo with a warrior\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/p1150813.jpg?w=640\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a></p>\n<dl class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_1252\" style=\"width:650px;\">\n<dd class=\"wp-caption-dd\">Jo with a warrior</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Its true what they say, that no two warrior looks alike, that they were all modeled on individual men and looking around at them you can see it.

        "contents": "<span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">Next stop, Chengdu. This is a pretty big city, but is mostly known for the Giant Panda Rescue Centre here. That was, of course, the reason we stopped here too.</span> It was a fantastic day, they're so cute! We both completely fell in love with them and the red pandas they have there. The site was surprisingly big, with lots of different enclosures. We were very lucky as it was still early enough and cool enough for them to still be out and moving about. One mother and cub kept us entertained for ages as we guessed when the younger one would lose his footing and fall off. Don't worry, I managed to capture the moment on film (along with plenty of others during the day) that I will more than happily show everyone when we get back! Being Autumn, we were also fortunate enough to be there at the right time to see some cubs. Three new pandas entered the world one month before we arrived, and were still tiny balls of fluff in a cot when we were quickly hurried past their window. They were adorable, especially the one laying flat out with just four little paws just poking out!! There must have been a lot of births this year, as another enclosure had lots of pandas only just bigger than the new borns. Most of them were piled on top of each other asleep under a tree, but one was up and moving around. The keeper brought him down onto the grass, layed him on his back so he could have a look around and we could see his face. The panda didn't seem to like being left here, as he was  turning his head looking for the man, he then managed to flip himself over and slowly crawl back up the hill after him. I could have watched all day, but I think Tom was a tad panda-ed out by then!! Apart from seeing the pandas, in Chengdu we also saw the world's largest building. needless to say, it was huge! There a water park in it and countless hotels, but as an attraction there's very little you can actually walk around. Oh well, kept us busy for an afternoon. The other big thing to do when in this province, is try the infamous hot pot. Tom, two friend of ours and I shared one giant bowl of what can only be described as chili broth. It was so spicy, but perfect for cooking all the meat and vegetables that come on skewers. Once they're cooked, out they come into your personal bowl of sesame oil. We were expecting the chili to get too much for us, but in the end it was the endless flavour of oil that eventually made us call it a night. Glad to have experienced it though. The last thing that happened in Chengdu that this blog wouldn't be complete without, is of course Tom's foot. For those of you who haven't heard about his spectacular trip to the supermarket, Tom had a bit of an accident. As it was around 4am, the hostel had shut its bar and locked their doors, including the front one. Not wanting to end the night with his new Aussie friend, he climbed over the wall of the courtyard and landed all his weight on his left foot. He continued to buy the beers and to drink them, but the price he paid is that he has been limping ever since. Silly boy!! Love Jo and Tom x",

        "contents": "<span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">So, after the quite lengthy train journey to Dali, we finally arrived and checked into our hostel at around 9pm, a good day and a half after leaving Hong Kong. First impressions were great. A nice little town, although tourism has left a mark, it doesn't take long to escape the purpose built \"old town\" and get into the real local alley ways and streets. The town being made up of traditional architecture, and having the remnants of the walls still surrounding parts, a few of the huge gates also still standing, was a nice place for us to absorb the Yunnan province feel for a few days.</span> On our second day in Dali we took a bus north to a town on the banks of the lake. This lake is rather large, apparently its possible to cycle around it in one day, however this requires you to be a degree of insane and very fit, not quite our cup of tea. Instead we wandered around yet another town, trying out local food, getting a brief insight into the day to day happenings of a small fishing town. We saw many a fisherman collecting something from their nets, a type of white worm which by hitting the nets they flipped off into a larger, collection net. It was at an adjacent food stall that we got to try this thing, and Jo summed it up pretty well, \"fishy noodles\". I couldn't think of anything better to describe it. Spot on. From Dali we caught a bus to Lijiang, a much larger town/city in the north. The old town in Lijiang essentially being a huge version of the one in Dali, we had come mainly to use the town as a base for exploring Tiger Leaping gorge. This was so slick and well organised by our hostel it made our life super easy. We got a minibus from the hostel to the start of the walk in the morning. This meant we could start our walk and then sleep that night at a guesthouse along the way. Well, what spectacular scenery. I thought the guidebook had been over selling the place before we arrived, saying things like \"You can be stood on the path and look up 2 km to the summits and down 1km to the river below\". No exageration. There we were, walking along a well worn trail in the side of the valley, snowy white mountains above us, and a roaring river far below. At one point the temperature difference was particularly obvious in that we were walkinig next to cacti on the trail, yet being able to see the snow at the same time. Mad. Our first stop was at the Tea Horse guesthouse, a lovely little place. Our room had naturally, breath taking views. The rooftop terrace was an amazing place to sit and absorb the 360 panorama with a drink. A very surreal place to be. We ate great local food, a Naxi sandwich that somewhat resembles naan bread, however traditionally the egg goes on top of the sandwich and not within, pretty weird. Day two was much easier than day one, in that Jo carried her rucksack rather than me carrying both. Plus it was no longer an incredibly difficult ascent up 28 switch backs and many a rest, but a lovely, contour following, visually stunning path that led us along the valley before slowly descending to Tina's guesthouse. On day three we descended the gorge right down to the river bottom. The path was ridiculously shear, winding its way perfectly down a near vertical cliff face. It took us around 40 minutes to descend, taking many a photo. We'd taken the advice of some fellow travellers which was to descend whilst the path was still in the shade of the valley, they'd been caught on the exposed trail both on the way down and back up in the blistering heat and apparently, its pretty bad. Due to the good advice, we got to the bottom fresh and non-melted which was nice. We sat on a large rock right in the centre of the fury of the river. A fantastic feeling, so much water racing past, carving out the marvels that we'd just walked. We saw the rock which apparently gave the gorge its name and I for one don't really think a tiger could have crossed there. Maybe if it was a massive tiger and the river wasn't any where near as high or powerful at a different time of year, but its most likely a myth. The ascent was as you can imagine, difficult. Not impossible mind, and after an hour and 20 minutes we we're back on the plateau that the road and guesthouse occupied. We grabbed a bit to eat and a bus back to Lijiang, thoroughly shattered from all the walking. So Lijiang, well, what a place for a start. Busy, a word that applies to most Chinese tourist towns and Lijiang certainly plays that role very well. The old/new narrow streets full of tourists at all hours, although funnily enough we did have a great time here. The market on the edge of the old town holds a lot of the vibe of the people, and it certainly has many of the characters of the area. We found great pleasure in trying to be a fly on the wall, sitting with a tea watching people bartering over goods or arranging their stall in the perfect manner, meticulous to every detail. One key thing about these Chinese faux old towns is that every fifth shop say, is the same. Once you've walked one stretch or one street, you can generally work out what the distribution of all the shops is. This can play to both hands however as it certainly reduces the excitement in exploring the place, however if you find something you like thats too expensive, you can almost guarantee it will be cheaper elsewhere! Another great experience we had in Lijiang was a \"family meal\". Some friends we'd made on the walk had been staying at a different guesthouse to ourselves, one which in the evening hosted this family dinner. On their recommendation we went to join in and I'm so glad we did. The food was amazing, loads of different dishes of varying flavours, from different mixes of vegetables to fried snacks or chunks of meat or fish. Our bowls kept getting filled and we met some great people too. One guy, a painter who actually travels with all his painting gear. He'd walked the gorge a few days earlier and done a painting which he showed us. Such a talented guy. Before long it was time to say good bye to Lijiang and board our next night train. Although this one was probably better called a night day night train as we boarded it at 6pm on the Thursday, changed trains in Kunming from 6am til 9am, and then arrived in Chengdu at 5.30am on Saturday. Yea, it was long!\n\nTom &amp; Jo",

        "contents": "No trip to China would be complete without a visit to the Northern part of the country, for a glimpse of the famous Great Wall. We decided against the standard tour and did it ourselves. From Xi'an we arrived in Beijing, but didn't see any of the sights there at this point. Instead we stopped just for the night to leave our bags, then set off the next morning to give us maximum wall time. From Beijing, Tom, Mike (a Canadian guy we'd met in Xi'an) and I got a public bus and taxi to the small village just outside the entrance of one part of the wall. We saw the wall briefly as we sped past it on the highways, but I didn't get a good look until sunset when I left the boys hiding from the cold to climb one of the hills behind us. I got there perfectly timed for sunset and got my first real view of the wall in golden light. It was incredible and went on for as far as the eye could see. Needless to say, I was pretty excited about the following day. The next morning, bright and early, we took our first steps. And boy was it steep! Part of what make the views of the wall so spectacular is how it rises and falls over the many hills, embedded among hundreds more. There were a lot of steps involved, some of which crumbling away, but completely worth the hard graft. Just like the night before, I couldn't see the end of the wall, it just kept going on and on. That is probably because it spans over a massive area of over 21000 km! It was built in sections, by different emperors, who slowly pieced parts together and extended it. In total it was never a continuous wall, but took advantage of the treacherous mountains as a natural barrier to fill in the gaps. A lot of what we walked has been restored, but some has been left in its ruined state, which for us was the perfect combination. Tourism is the only reason it now remains, as it was left to ruin for many years. Chairman Mao even encouraged people to use it as free building materials! Once up on the wall, it was decision time as to which direction to walk in. The sun was still so low that only to the right of us was in it, so of course we took that route. Even then it was still freezing cold, with the wind making it even more so. Good job it was such a tough climb just so we could warm up! In the end we walked for a good four hours. For most of this time we had the whole thing to ourselves, that was until a school trip arrived and they all decided to run the whole way! Thankfully, their planned route wasn't as long as ours, so they soon got shuttled back onto their tour bus and peace was restored. It was a fantastic day to view it on. Even with only one functioning foot, Tom still managed to climb the entire thing, and was a head of me for most of it. Problems only occurred when we stopped and it began to throb. Maybe walking the Great Wall of China on it was a push too far!! <a href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/p1160193.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1226\" alt=\"Crumbling under foot\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/p1160193.jpg?w=640\" width=\"640\" height=\"853\" /></a>\n\n<dl class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_1226\" style=\"width:650px;\"><dd class=\"wp-caption-dd\">Crumbling under foot</dd></dl>Overall it was a fantastic day. We were all so glad that we'd arrived the day before to give ourselves the full day to fully appreciate it. Bidding the wall farewell, we fell exhausted into a taxi to head back to Beijing. For Tom and I, this was the final stop!!!!\n\nLove Jo and Tom xx\n\n<a href=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/p1160190.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1225\" alt=\"P1160190\" src=\"http://greenteaandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/p1160190.jpg?w=640\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a>",

        "title": "The Final Stop",
        "contents": "Where has the year gone? Before we knew it we were in Beijing, checking into our final room. It was a very strange feeling thinking we'd wouldn't have to hunt for a room any more, or carry our bags more than one more time. In a way, we treated the final stop as more of a holiday and relaxed far more than we have done. Of course we still saw the main sights, but we have certainly slowed down from when we'd rush around a city trying to see everything and anything. At this point in the game, we were far more selective, as temples just don't have the effect they once did! The biggest attraction was the Forbidden City. Back in 1406, and for the duration of the following 24 emperors, this was where Beijing was ruled from. It is actually a palace complex, full of countless buildings, rooms and courtyards. It is the largest in the world, and it certainly felt like it. It was beautiful and very grand, every time we thought we\u00b4d seen most of it, it would open up to show off more impressive buildings and courtyards!  There are 980 buildings in total! The sad side of it though, is that during it\u00b4s heyday, the Emperors lived in here with vast space and expense, whilst the population outside was struggle to say alive. It is called the Forbidden Palace as for 500 years it was invite only. To be caught entering without an invitation meant immediate execution. Over the road, are yet more famous images of China; Tiananmen square and the giant painting of Chairman Mao. The painting is on the gate from which Mao declared The People's Republic of China on 1st October 1949. This is why there is such a massive holiday in November, and why we struggled to find accommodation then!! As such iconic images of the entire country, it was very exciting to see them in real life. Besides thinking the painting was going to be at least double the size it was, it didn't disappoint. In the area is also the mausoleum of Mao, which was creepy more than anything, but, hey, when in China... In a complete contrast from the ancient central, there is an area famous for its many art galleries and quirky shops. Known as District 798, this area was a fantastic place for a wander around viewing such an eclectic of art. It used to be an industrial estate, which seems to just add to the art, hippie vibe. We saw a ridiculous number of amateur photo shoots taken place on abandoned train tracks or by old factories!! <span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">Being our final stop, we also took advantage of not having to carry everything anymore, plus everything being so cheap. This could mean only one thing, shopping! Having not done it really for a year, we were both looking forward to it. That enthusiasm lasted about an hour before the craziness of Chinese markets and shopping centers left us exhausted!</span> To conclude our time in China, we of course had to experience some of the things it is most famous for. The first being attending an acrobats show. It was fantastic with all the usual circus acts and computer graphics galore, although based on the stereotype, we were expecting them to be EVEN more mind-blowing acts. That being said, neither of us could have done a single stunt they did, so we have nothing but admiration for them! The second must do for us before we left, was to have Peking duck. Not ones to ever do things in half  measure, we ordered an entire duck!! It was delicious, making us both wonder why we hadn't been eating it every night for dinner!! We'd both go back just for that meal!! <span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">Before too long, it was time to pack our bags, bid farewell and allow a lot of time for Tom to hobble to the airport!!</span> Goodbye China!!\n\nLove Jo and Tom x",

Starting in Ghana back in August 2012, where we volunteered for two months, we then had a brief visit home (and to Germany!), before beginning the big adventure of a year in Asia. In total we were away for 60 weeks and visited 11 countries, and loved every single one of them.\n\nThere have of course been extreme highs and lows, but it has been a fantastic experience that will stay with us forever. We have so many stories to tell, that you may still be hearing new ones when we're 40!\n\nThank you to everyone who has been a part of it, either on the trip or our reliable network of friends and family back home. We hope we have made you suitably jealous, and will gladly give any travel advice to anyone we've inspired to visit these incredible places. If not, then stayed tuned because this is not the end of a jet setting ways. They'll be plenty more trips to come, but for now the next big adventure will be of employment!! Goodbye, and love from\n\nJo and Tom x",
